      <p>Just as every artist is different, every Art Kit is different, suited
      to the person who put it together. A street artist’s kit may be full of
      spray cans, while a “traditional” artist’s may be full of brush and
      canvas. Ultimately however, artists have more in common than they do
      apart; a desire to send a message, and the vision to see it
      done.</p><p><strong>Starting Charges:</strong> 10 (Refill Cost 20 LMD per
      Charge)</p><h3>Uses</h3><p><strong>Create Art (2 Charge) (Partially
      Automated: Add the results manually):</strong> As a Long Rest Activity,
      you can create a piece of Art; this Art can depict whatever you wish. To
      do so, you must make a DC13 Wisdom Check; if you are Proficient with this
      Kit, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to this roll. On a success, the
      Art you create is valuable, and can be sold for normal price (100 LMD)
      (Add a @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-items.Item.LTqDRnseEV181JdH]{Valuable
      Artwork} to your Sheet). On a failure, you still create the Art, but its
      value is reduced to 0 LMD (Add a
      @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-items.Item.YCAnw2AH0ZhbsvIK]{Non-Valuable
      Artwork} to your Sheet).</p><p><strong>Mark (1 Charge):</strong> Over the
      course of a minute, you can quickly sketch/spray/paint a symbol or sign
      onto a material or the environment.</p><h3>Proficient
      Uses</h3><p><strong>Artist’s Eye:</strong> Your familiarity with art and
      its tools gives you insight into deciphering the meanings behind art. You
      have a +5 modifier to any Check to determine meaning or messages in art,
      including hidden messages and codes, as well as the mindset of the person
      who made that art.</p><p><strong>Disguise Appearance (2 Charges):</strong>
      Your expertise with your tools allows you (either doing it yourself or
      instructing others), as a Long Rest Activity, to paint an object, vehicle,
      or piece of armour into a design of your choice. This design could be
      camouflage, providing a bonus to Stealth Checks involving the subject, or
      even a disguise to disguise the subject as belonging to a particular
      faction.</p>
