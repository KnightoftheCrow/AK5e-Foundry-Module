      <p>Cooking food could be argued to be one of the things that defines
      civilisation; one of the things that divides man from animal. People with
      a good meal in their bellies can bear hardship that the hungry cannot, and
      the person that can provide this will be forever beloved. The Cooking Kit
      contains the tools necessary to cook away from a kitchen, in addition to a
      spread of long-life ingredients.</p><p><strong>Starting Charges:</strong>
      5 (Refill cost 40 LMD per Charge)</p><h3>Uses</h3><p><strong>Create
      Rations (1 Charge):</strong> Without the aid of a kitchen, sometimes just
      keeping people from starving to death is enough. As a Long Rest Activity,
      you can cook enough Rations to feed a number of people equal to your
      Wisdom Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.</p><p><strong>Prepare
      Ingredients (Partially Automated; does not manually restore
      charges):</strong> As a Short Rest Activity, you can either scavenge
      vegetation or prepare a dead animal for consumption (if there is one
      available). To do so, you must make a DC13 Wisdom Check; if you are
      Proficient in this Kit, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to this Roll.
      Furthermore, if you are preparing an animal, you have Advantage on this
      Roll. On a success, you restore one Charge of this Kit, up to its maximum
      of 5. On a failure, you waste the ingredients, and do not restore a
      Charge.</p><h3>Proficient Uses</h3><p><strong>Camp Cooking (2
      Charge):</strong> Being in the wilderness is no excuse for anyone to eat
      badly. As a Long Rest Activity, you can create a Meal for a number of
      Creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus + Wisdom Modifier (unless it is
      negative). Creatures that consume the meal roll one of their Hit Dice
      (this does not expend their Hit Dice) and gain that many Temporary Hit
      Points.</p><p><strong>Poison Tasting (Auotmated):</strong> Your expertise
      with the tools of cooking gives you special insight. Using these tools,
      you can identify whether food is safe or dangerous to eat by succeeding on
      a DC13 Perception Check.</p>
