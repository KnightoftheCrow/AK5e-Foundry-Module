      <p>Alcohol is a nearly universal truth in all civilisations. It bridges
      gaps and opens doors in a way that words alone often cannot. The talents
      and tools used in creating it, however, have more than one application,
      turning poisoned and polluted water into lifesaving drinking water. The
      brewer can always find a place, or people, who need them. The Brewer’s Kit
      contains brewing and distillation equipment, as well as instruments for
      monitoring the contents of fluids.</p><p><strong>Starting
      Charges:</strong> 10 (Refill Cost 45 LMD per
      Charge)</p><h3>Uses</h3><p><strong>Brew Alcohol (2 Charges) (Partially
      Automated; add the results manually):</strong> As a Long Rest Activity,
      you can begin to brew alcohol. It finishes brewing when you next complete
      a Long Rest; the number of servings brewed is equal to your Proficiency
      Bonus. To do so, when it finishes brewing, you must make a DC13 Wisdom
      Check; if you are Proficient in this Kit, you may add your Proficiency
      Bonus to this roll. On a success, the Alcohol you create is valuable, and
      can be sold for normal price (25 LMD) (Add a
      @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-items.Item.aoWObPYKCfH44Ew2]{Valuable Alcohol}
      to your Sheet). On a failure, you still create the alcohol, but it is of
      lower quality, and its value is reduced to 0 (Add a
      @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-items.Item.o9ItelFHz1EoGDlE]{Non-Valuable
      Alcohol} to your Sheet).</p><blockquote><p><span
      style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><span
      style="text-decoration:underline">Alcohol</span></strong></span></p><p>Alcohol
      has been a feature of almost every civilisation since mankind learned the
      art of fermentation. It can break the ice between strangers, either as a
      gift, or through removing their inhibitions.</p><p>A Creature that
      consumes Alcohol has a -1 Modifier to Dexterity Checks and Saving Throws,
      but a +1 to Charisma Checks and Wisdom Saving
      Throws.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Purify Water (1 Charge):</strong> As a
      Short Rest Activity, you can use the distilling tools present in this kit
      to purify enough water for a single person to drink for one
      day.</p><h3>Proficient Uses</h3><p><strong>Analyse Fluids:</strong> Modern
      brewing is a careful, scientific process that requires close monitoring
      and fine instrumentation in order to avoid contamination. Using the
      instruments and your knowledge, you can grant yourself a +5 bonus to any
      check to determine the contents of a body of liquid, including if it is
      poisoned/alcoholic/etc<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Mass Purify Water
      (3 Charges):</strong> Your familiarity with the kit allows you to process
      vast amounts of fluid when you have concerted time to work at it. As a
      Long Rest Activity, you may purify enough drinking water for a number of
      people equal to your Wisdom Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.</p>
