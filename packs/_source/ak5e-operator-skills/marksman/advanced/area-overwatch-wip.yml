  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a Creature you can see within 100ft of you moves 5 or more feet
      during their Turn, you can make a Ranged Weapon Attack against them as a
      Reaction. If this Attack hits, you regain use of your Reaction. However,
      you can only Attack each Creature once per Turn. This Skill ends early if
      you move more than 5 feet during a Turn.</p>
