    value: >-
      <p>You fire an explosive shell in a 60 foot long, 5 ft wide Line
      originating from you. All Creatures on this Line must succeed on a
      Dexterity Saving Throw against your Martial DC, or take 4d6 Piercing
      Damage. If this line intersects with a wall or other structure, the shell
      explodes; all Creatures within a 15 foot Sphere centred on the point of
      intersection must make a DC18 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed Save,
      they take 8d6 Thunder Damage. On a successful Save, they take half as much
      Damage. When you use this Operator Skill, you can optionally designate one
      wall or object no more than 1 foot thick that intersects with the line;
      the shell drills through this wall without exploding, and will explode on
      its next contact with a wall or object.</p>
