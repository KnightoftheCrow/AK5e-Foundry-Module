  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose three points you can see within 30 feet of you. All Creatures
      within 10 feet of each of those points, and not in Total Cover, must make
      a Dexterity Saving Throw against your Martial DC. On a failed Save, they
      take 5d6 Thunder Damage. On a successful Save, they take half as much
      Damage. A Creature can only take Damage from this Skill once in a Turn,
      even if they are within multiple spheres.</p>
