      <p><em>(Note: when added to a character sheet, remember to enable the
      Tracking Bar!)</em><br /><br />At 2nd Level, 7th Level, and 14th Level,
      you gain a Basic, Advanced, and Elite Operator Skill respectively from the
      Skill Tables available to your Class (found after the Class Features for
      each Class). Some Branches may provide additional options for Skill
      selection; some may require you to select an Operator Skill from a
      different table.</p><p>Operator Skills have the following
      properties:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the
      Skill.</p></li><li><p><strong>SP Cost:</strong> How many Skill Points (SP)
      are required to Activate that Skill. Your maximum amount of Skill Points
      is equal to the highest Required SP of all your current
      Skills.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start SP:</strong> Whenever you finish a
      Long Rest, if you have less Skill Points than this Value, you gain Skill
      Points until you have this value. If you have multiple Skills with a
      Starting SP, use the highest one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charging
      Method:</strong> Each Skill allows you to gain Skill Point in one of three
      ways. You cannot gain Skill Points if you currently have an Active Skill,
      from an Attack made or Art cast as part of a Skill, from Damage dealt by a
      Skill, or by Hit Points restore.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automatic:</strong>
      You gain 2 Skill Points at the Beginning of your Turn in
      combat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Offensive:</strong> You gain 1 Skill Point
      whenever you do any of the following during your Turn in
      combat:</p><ul><li><p>Deal Damage to a hostile Creature; this can only
      occur once per Attack.</p></li><li><p>Restore Hit Points to a Creature
      except yourself.</p></li><li><p>Grant Temporary Hit Points to a Creature
      (except yourself) with an
      Art.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Defensive:</strong> You gain 2 Skill
      Points whenever a hostile Creature makes an Attack against you, or you
      take Damage from a hostile Creature through a non-Attack
      source.</p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><span
      style="text-decoration:underline"><span
      style="text-decoration:underline">Stacking Charging
      Methods</span></span></p><p>Each of your current Skills allows you to gain
      SP through its associated method, and these methods can stack. If you had
      2 Offensive Charge Skills, you would gain 2 SP if you damaged a Creature
      with an Attack.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Activation
      Cost:</strong> The Action Cost required to Activate that Skill. Typically,
      this is either Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, or no Action
      required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effect:</strong> What the Skill does upon
      being Activated. Note that if a Skill calls for something you do not have
      access to without an alternative, such as a Spell Save DC, you cannot use
      that Operator Skill.</p></li><li><p><strong>Duration</strong>: The length
      of time that Skill remains Active.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><span
      style="text-decoration:underline"><span
      style="text-decoration:underline">One Skill at a
      Time</span></span></p><p>A Character can only have one Operator Skill
      active at a time, even if they have the Skill Points to activate
      another.</p></blockquote>
