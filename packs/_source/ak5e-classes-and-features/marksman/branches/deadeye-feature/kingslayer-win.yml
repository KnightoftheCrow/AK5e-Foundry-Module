      <p>To you, the emphasis in “High Value Target” is the word “Target.” You
      gain the following benefits: </p><p><strong>Lethal.</strong> Your Attacks
      against Elite and Leader Creatures have +1 Critical Range. If that
      Creature is also your Target, your Critical Range is increased by a
      further +1.</p><p><strong>Make it Count.</strong> When you roll the Damage
      Roll for Attacks against Elite and Leader Creatures, you may roll one
      additional Damage Dice, and discard the lowest result.</p>
