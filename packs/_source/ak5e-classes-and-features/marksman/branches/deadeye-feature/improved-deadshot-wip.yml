      <p>You now additionally gain the following benefits while in Deadshot
      State:</p><p><strong>Deathblow.</strong> If your Attack reduces a Creature
      to fewer Hit Points than your Marksman Level, they are immediately reduced
      to 0 Hit Points. For Elite and Leader Creatures, this threshold is twice
      your Marksman Level instead.</p><p><strong>Piercing Shots.</strong>
      Creatures do not receive the benefit of Half or Three-Quarters Cover
      against your Attacks.</p>
