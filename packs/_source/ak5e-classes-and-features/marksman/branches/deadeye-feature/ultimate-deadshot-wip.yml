    value: >-
      <p>You never miss a target. Your name will enter the history books of
      sharpshooters. You now additionally gain the following benefits while in
      Deadshot State:</p><p><strong>Killchain</strong>. If you reduce a Creature
      to 0 Hit Points with a Ranged Attack, your next usage of your Deadshot
      Feature may be performed without expending your Bonus
      Action.</p><p><strong>Nevermiss.</strong> When you make a Ranged Attack
      Roll, if the result on the d20 is less than the Ability Modifier used for
      the Attack + your Proficiency Bonus (not doubled by Unerring Accuracy), it
      instead becomes that value.</p>
