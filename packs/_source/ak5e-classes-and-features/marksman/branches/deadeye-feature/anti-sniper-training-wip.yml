      <p>Keep low, and keep your profile small. That’s how you survive when the
      bolts and bullets start flying. </p><p>After you enter Deadshot, you gain
      the benefit of Half Cover until the beginning of your next Turn. If you
      would gain the benefit of Half Cover from a different source, you instead
      gain the benefit of Three-Quarters Cover while you are benefitting from
      that additional source.</p>
