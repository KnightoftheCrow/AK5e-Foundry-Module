      <p>You may enter Deadshot State as a Bonus Action; Deadshot State ends at
      the end of your Turn, or after you make an Attack. While in Deadshot
      State, your Ranged Attacks gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Additional Weapon Damage.</strong> Your Attacks
      deal an additional die of Weapon Damage.</p><p><strong>Long Range
      Shooting.</strong> You suffer no penalty for Attacking at Long
      Range.</p><p><strong>Unerring Accuracy.</strong> Your Proficiency Bonus is
      doubled for that Attack Roll.</p>
