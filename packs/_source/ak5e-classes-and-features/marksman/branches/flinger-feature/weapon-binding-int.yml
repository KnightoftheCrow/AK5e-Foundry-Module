      <p>You learn to imprint your Arts onto a Weapon to bettermanipulate
      it.</p><p><strong>Binding Ritual.</strong> Over the course of ten minutes,
      whichcan be done during a Rest, you can bind to a MeleeWeapon. The weapon
      must be within your reacht hroughout the ritual, at the conclusion of
      which youtouch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails ifanother
      Creature is bonded to it, or if the weapon is amagic item to which someone
      else is attuned.</p><p>The maximum number of Bound Weapons you can haveis
      1; this is increased to 2 at Level 7, and 3 at Level
      14.</p><p><strong>Using a Bound Weapon.</strong> A Weapon Bound to you
      floatsin an empty space as close to you as possible, moving when you do,
      until commanded otherwise. When taking the Attack Action, instead of
      making your normal Attacks, you can command each of your Bound Weapons to
      move up to 30 feet in any direction to alocation you can see; Weapons can
      move through Creature’s spaces during this movement, but cannot finish
      this movement in a Creature’s space. The Bound Weapon then floats at this
      location.</p><p>After this movement, you can make a Melee Attack with each
      of your Bound Weapons that has a Creature within 5 feet of it (10 feet if
      the Bound Weapon has the Reach Property). These Weapon Attacks use your
      SpellcastingAbility Modifier (instead of Strength or Dexterity) for the
      Attack and Damage rolls, and you are considered to be Proficient with
      those Weapons for these Attacks.</p><p>Additionally, if you have cast a
      levelled Art during yourTurn, until the end of that Turn you can move one
      ofyour Bound Weapons (but not Attack with it) as a
      BonusAction.</p><p><strong>Opportunity Attacks with Bound
      Weapons.</strong> If a Creature would voluntarily leave the reach of one
      ofyour Bound Weapons, you may make an Attack of Opportunity against them
      with one of those Bound Weapons; this does not consume your Reaction,
      butonce a Bound Weapon has made an Attack ofOpportunity, it cannot do so
      again until the start of yournext Turn.</p><p><strong>Recalling Bound
      Weapons.</strong> You can recall all of your Bound Weapon within 100 feet
      to your side as an Action; they resume floating in an empty space as close
      to you as possible, and move when you do. If a Bound Weapon is ever more
      than 100 feet away from you, your Arts lose their hold, and it ceases to
      be Bound to you.</p><p><strong>Partially automated:</strong> Use to bind
      Melee Weapon with you to apply Spellcasting Ability to Weapon. You get
      dummy profiency for all Melee Weapon.</p>
