      <p>The Arts you use to manoeuvre your weapons can have other applications.
      You can cast Arts; the information below details how you use those rules
      as a Flinger.</p><p><strong>Arts Points</strong>. The Flinger Arts Casting
      table shows how many Arts Points you have to cast your Level 1+ Arts. You
      regain all expended Arts Points when you finish a Long Rest. When you cast
      an Art, if that Art only affects either you (such as Mage Armour, or
      Heroism cast on yourself) or your Target (in the case of Arts that affect
      an area, they are the only Creature in that area), that Art costs 1 fewer
      Art Point, to a minimum of 0.</p><p><strong>Maximum Arts Level.</strong>
      The Flinger Arts Casting table shows the maximum Level you can cast an Art
      at, based on your Marksman Level. If an Art’s Level is above your current
      Maximum Art Level, you cannot cast it, even if it is
      Prepared.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> When you gain this
      Feature, choose either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma; that is your
      Spellcasting Ability.</p><p><strong>Flinger Arts Pools.</strong> When you
      gain this Feature, choose two of the Standard Arts Pools available to the
      Caster Class; you learn all of the levelled Arts of 4th Level or less from
      those Pools. These Arts are always Prepared.</p><p><strong>Not
      automated.</strong></p>
