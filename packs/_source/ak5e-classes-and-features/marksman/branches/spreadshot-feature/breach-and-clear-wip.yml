    value: >-
      <p>Your attacks are resonant, booming, and lethal. Enemies that survive
      them find themselves unable to coordinate their counterattack.</p><p>A
      Creature that takes Damage from you while you are within 30 feet is unable
      to make Opportunity Attacks until the beginning of your next Turn. If you
      score a Critical Hit against a Creature, or they fail a Saving Throw
      against your Pepperbox or Centre of Mass Feature, they instead cannot take
      any Reactions until the start of your next Turn.</p>
