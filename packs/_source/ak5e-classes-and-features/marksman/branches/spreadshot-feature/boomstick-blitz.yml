      <p>Simply being in a room with you is enough to condemn a foe to
      death.</p><p>As an Action while you are wielding a weapon with the Spread
      Property, you can make a Ranged Attack using that weapon against every
      Creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. You can
      only Attack each Creature once as part of this Action.</p><p>Once you have
      used this Feature, you may not do so again until you have completed a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Not Automated.</strong></p>
