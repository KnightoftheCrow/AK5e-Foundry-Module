    value: >-
      <p>As an Action while you are wielding a weapon with the Spread Property,
      you fire a hail of lacerating projectiles in a 10ft Cube originating from
      you. All Creatures within the area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw
      against your Martial DC, taking 3d6 Piercing Damage and gaining the
      Bleeding Condition on a failed Save. On a successful Save, they take half
      as much Damage, and suffer no other effects. A Creature that is your
      Target has Disadvantage on this Saving Throw.</p><p>You may use this
      Feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all
      expended uses upon finishing a Long Rest.</p>
