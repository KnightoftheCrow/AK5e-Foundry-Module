      <p>You learn the art of putting down a single foe quickly.</p><p>As an
      Action while you are wielding a weapon with the Spread Property, choose a
      Creature you can see within 15 feet. That Creature must make a Dexterity
      Saving Throw against your Martial DC; on a failed Save, they take 8d6
      Piercing Damage, and if they are Large or smaller, they are knocked Prone
      and 20 feet directly away from you. On a successful Save, they take half
      as much Damage, and suffer no other effects.</p><p>Once you have used this
      Feature, you may not do so again until you have completed a Short or Long
      Rest.</p>
