    value: >-
      <p>Your Attacks strike with such force that they can punch through
      multiple foes.</p><p>When you make a Ranged Attack against a Creature
      within the Normal Range of that Weapon, that Attack has +1 Critical Range.
      Additionally, if you reduce that Creature to 0 Hit Points with an Attack
      using your Custom Job, and there is another Creature that
      is:</p><ul><li><p>Behind the original Creature from your
      perspective.</p></li><li><p>Within 10 feet of the original
      Creature.</p></li><li><p>Has an AC equal to or less than the Attack Roll
      made for that Attack.</p></li></ul><p>That Creature then takes any excess
      Damage from the initial Attack. If the Creature reduced to 0 was your
      Target, then roll an additional die of Damage for that Attack, and add it
      to the excess Damage taken by the second Creature.</p>
