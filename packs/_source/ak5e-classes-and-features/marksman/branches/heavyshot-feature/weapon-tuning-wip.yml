  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You learn how to get the absolute most out of your weapon- even if it
      isn’t what could be called “safe”.</p><p>As a Long Rest Activity, you may
      modify a Heavy Ranged Weapon, turning it into a Custom Job. A Custom Job
      gains the following effects:</p><p><strong>Exploding Damage.</strong>
      Whenever Damage is rolled for an Attack with that Weapon, if one of the
      dice results is the maximum result possible on that dice, the attacker may
      roll an additional die of the same size, and add the result to the Damage.
      The maximum number of dice that can be added is equal to the attacker’s
      Proficiency Bonus.</p><p><strong>Heaviest Shot.</strong> If that Weapon
      has the Loading Property, it deals an additional die of Damage.
      </p><p><strong>Shortened Range.</strong> The Normal and Long Range values
      of that Weapon are halved. </p><p>As a Result of your Modifications, only
      you can handle your Custom Job- all other Creatures are not considered
      Proficient with a Custom Job, even if they wouldnormally have Proficiency
      with the Weapon.</p>
