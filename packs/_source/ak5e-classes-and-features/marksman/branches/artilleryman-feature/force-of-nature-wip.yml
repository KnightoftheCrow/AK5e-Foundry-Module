      <p>No fortification is proof against your cataclysmic explosions. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Scatter Them.</strong> Once per
      Short Rest, when you deal Thunder Damage as a result of a Weapon with the
      Splash (X) Property you can cause all Creatures that take that Damage to
      be blown away (no Action required); Creatures are flung 30 feet away from
      the centre of the blast. If they collide with a solid surface as a result
      of this movement, they take 4d8 Bludgeoning Damage.</p><p><strong>Siege
      Attacker.</strong> When you deal Thunder Damage to a Vehicle or Structure,
      that Damage is doubled.</p>
