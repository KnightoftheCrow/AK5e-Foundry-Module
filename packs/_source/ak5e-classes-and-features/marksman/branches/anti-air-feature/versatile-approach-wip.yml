      <p>You know a litany of techniques and options for dealing with the
      variety of threats you face. This is represented by your Options, detailed
      below.</p><p>When you meet the conditions outlined by each Option, you can
      perform that Option. You can only use one Option on each Attack.</p><p>You
      can use your Options a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
      You recover all expended uses whenever you finish a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Area Denial:</strong> You can use this Option as a
      Bonus Action while you are wielding a Ranged Weapon; choose a point you
      can see within the long range of that Weapon.</p><p>At the beginning of
      your next Turn, a rain of projectiles falls down from that point in a
      10-footradius cylinder, where the height reaches up to the point you
      chose. All Creatures within this cylinder must make a Dexterity Saving
      Throw against your Martial DC, taking 3d6 Piercing Damage on a failed
      Save, or half as much on a successful Save. Flying Creatures have
      Disadvantage on this Saving Throw, and if they fail, their Flying Speed is
      halved until the end of their next Turn.</p><p><strong>Crowd
      Control:</strong> You can use this Option when you make a Ranged Weapon
      Attack (no Action required); you repeat that Ranged Attack against a
      different Creature within 15 feet of the original Creature, but that
      attack deals half Damage.</p><p><strong>Stop their Approach:</strong> You
      can use this Option when you hit a Creature with a Ranged Weapon Attack
      (no Action required); that Creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw
      against your Martial DC or have their Speed reduced by 20 feet until the
      end of their next Turn. This effect is cumulative.</p><p><strong>Shoot to
      Kill:</strong> You can use this Option when you hit a Creature with a
      Ranged Weapon Attack (no Action required); that Creature takes 1d6
      Piercing Damage for each time you have dealt Damage to them since your
      last Turn, except if that Damage was dealt by this Option.</p>
