      <p>The art of being a generalist is the art of having many tools on which
      to rely; the more effective, the better. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Option Recharge.</strong> If you roll Initiative
      and have less than your maximum uses of your Versatile Approach Feature
      remaining, you recover 1 use.</p><p><strong>Upgraded Options.</strong> The
      Options of your Versatile Approach Feature are improved in the following
      ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Area Denial:</strong> The cylinder created
      lingers for an additional round; Creatures that enter the area or end
      their Turn within it must make the Saving Throw as if they were within the
      area when it appeared. Additionally, when you use this Option, you may
      nominate any number of Creatures that can hear you to be immune to its
      effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crowd Control:</strong> You may repeat the
      Attack an additional time; however, it must be against a different
      Creature than the other two, and still deals half
      Damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stop their Approach:</strong> Creatures
      that succeed on this Saving Throw still have their Speed reduced by 10
      feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shoot to Kill:</strong> The Damage of this
      Option is increased to 1d8 per instance of Damage you have dealt to that
      Creature since your last Turn.</p></li></ul>
