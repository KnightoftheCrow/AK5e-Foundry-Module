  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a hostile Creature enters the normal range of a Ranged Weapon you
      are wielding, or moves while within 30 feet of you, you may make a Ranged
      Attack against them with that Weapon as a Reaction. If the Creature is
      your Target, this does not expend your Reaction. However, once you have
      attacked a Creature in this way, you may not attack that Creature in this
      way again until the beginning of your next Turn.</p><p>After you make this
      Attack, you may move up to half of your Speed; this movement does not
      provoke Opportunity Attacks.</p>
