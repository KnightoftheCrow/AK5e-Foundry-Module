      <p>Sometimes, when the chips are down, it is not sufficienct to carefully
      weigh ones options and act prudently. Sometimes, it is better to do
      anything rather than nothing. That sometimes is now.</p><p>You may
      activate this Feature during your Turn (no Action required). Once on each
      of your Turns for the next minute, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You may use one of your <strong>Options</strong>
      without expending a use of your Versatile Approach
      Feature.</p></li><li><p>When you take the Attack Action, you may make one
      additional Ranged Weapon Attack as part of that
      Action.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this Feature, you may not do so
      again until you have finished a Long Rest.</p>
