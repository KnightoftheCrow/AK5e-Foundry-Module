    value: >-
      <p>Just as David did, your shots can stop giants in their tracks. Once per
      Turn, when you hit a Creature with a Ranged Weapon Attack while in Siege
      Mode, you can force that Creature (no Action required) to make a
      Constitution Saving Throw against your Martial DC. On a failed Save, they
      are Stunned until the end of their next Turn.</p><p>You may use this
      Feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all
      expended uses upon finishing a Long Rest.</p>
