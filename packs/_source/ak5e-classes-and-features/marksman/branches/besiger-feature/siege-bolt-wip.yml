    value: >-
      <p>A shot to pierce the heavens. As an Action, choose a Creature or Object
      you can see within 100 feet of you; that Creature must make a Dexterity
      Saving Throw (objects automatically fail) against your Martial DC. On a
      Successful Save, they suffer 5d8 Piercing Damage immediately, and no
      further effects. On a failed Save, they take 5d8 Piercing Damage
      immediately, and at the end of each of their next two turns. They may
      reattempt the Saving Throw at the beginning of their Turn, ending the
      effect early on a Success. Damage dealt by this Feature ignores
      Resistances and Damage Reduction to Piercing Damage.</p><p>Once you have
      used this Feature, you may not do so again until you have finished a Long
      Rest.</p>
