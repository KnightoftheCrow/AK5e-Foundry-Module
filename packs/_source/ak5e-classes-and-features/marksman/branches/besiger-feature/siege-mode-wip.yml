    value: >-
      <p>At the beginning of your Turn you may declare that you will enter Siege
      Mode (no Action required) until the end of that Turn. While in Siege Mode,
      your Speed is reduced to 0 (and cannot be increased), and you have
      Disadvantage on Ranged Weapon Attacks against Creatures within 20ft of
      you. However, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Additional
      Damage.</strong> Your Attacks deal 1d8 additional
      Damage.</p><p><strong>Crushing Shots.</strong> While they are Equipped by
      you, Ranged Weapons gain the Crush (X) Property, where X is equal to twice
      your Proficiency Bonus. If it already has the Crush (X) Property, add the
      values of X together and use that value for X.</p><p><strong>Ignore
      Brace.</strong> You ignore the effects of the Brace
      Property.</p><p><strong>Long Range Shooting.</strong> You suffer no
      penalty for Attacking at Long Range.</p>
