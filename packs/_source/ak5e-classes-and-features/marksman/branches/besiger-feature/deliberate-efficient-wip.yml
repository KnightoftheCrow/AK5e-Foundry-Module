      <p>If you slow your pace, you can place your shots to best pierce the
      defences of your prey.</p><p>When you take the Attack Action while in
      Siege Mode, you can choose to only make one Attack as part of that Action.
      If you do, that Attack deals 1d8 additional Damage, and ignores
      Resistances and Damage Reduction to Physical Damage.</p>
