  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an incredibly dense point of gravity in a 50-foot-radius
      sphere centred on a point you can see within range. The area within this
      sphere is considered to be Difficult Terrain; this applies even through
      solid objects.</p><p>At the start of each of your Turns, every Creature
      within the sphere must make a Strength Saving Throw. On a failed Save,
      they take 3d10 Force Damage and are pulled 20 feet towards the centre of
      the area. On a successful Save, they take half as much Damage, and are not
      pulled. Unsecured Objects are pulled 20 feet towards the centre
      automatically.</p><p>This pull is capable of pulling Creatures and Objects
      into the air unless they are secured to the ground in some way, such as by
      grabbing hold of objects that are secured. Creatures and Objects pulled
      into the air are suspended there until they return to the ground, escape
      the area, or the spell ends; in which case they fall directly downwards. A
      Creature that does not have a Fly or Hover Speed can only move by pushing
      or pulling against objects, including objects which are
      suspended.</p><p>If a Creature is pulled into the centre of the sphere,
      they take 8d10 Force Damage. A Creature that is reduced to 0 Hit Points by
      this Damage is instantly killed, crushed into an unrecognisable
      mass.</p><p>When you cast this Art, you may designate a number of
      Creatures you can see equal to your Spellcasting Ability Modifier + your
      Proficiency Bonus. Those Creatures automatically succeed on the Saving
      Throw.</p><p><strong>Partially Automated.</strong> Summons an Invincible
      Actor called Event Horizon Gravity Point that performs the Activities
      associated with this Art. Difficult Terrain is not automated. Trigger the
      Drag In Activity to force Creatures within the radius to make a Save, but
      they are not pulled automatically. Use the Crush Activity on any Creature
      that is dragged into the point.</p>
