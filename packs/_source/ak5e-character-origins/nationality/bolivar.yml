      <p>The history of Bolivar has always been troubled. The nation began as a
      colonial nation established by the Iberians due to its rich mines and
      soil, kickstarting a great colonial movement from Terra’s superpowers.
      Eventually, Iberia was forced to release the colony due to international
      pressure, granting Bolivar a brief period of independence before it fell
      under Leithanien influence, becoming a puppet state. Even this did not
      last; neighbouring Columbia broke free from its colonial masters in
      Victoria, and began to expand their own sphere of influence into Bolivar,
      resulting in a proxy conflict between them and Leithanien. The conflict
      continues to this day, and none can say who has the upper hand; but the
      Bolivarians themselves are the ones who suffer.</p><p>Bolivar is a nation
      divided, gripped by civil war. Politically speaking, Bolivar is not one
      state but two; the Kingdom of Bolivar, ruled by the Leithanien-backed
      Singas Dynasty, and the Sovereign State of Bolivar, ruled by the
      Columbian-backed Coalition Government. Both are fragile, ineffectual
      governments, and both compensate for this with authoritarian rule.
      Unofficially, there are two more factions; the True Bolivarians, and the
      city of Dossoles.</p><p>The True Bolivarians are a paramilitary junta made
      from a coalition of militias seeking to remove foreign powers from their
      land. The ideology of these militias range from extremists who want only
      anarchy to conformists to socialist revolutionaries, united only by the
      fact that their dislike of foreign powers is greater than their dislike
      for each other.</p><p>Finally, the city of Dossoles is the de jure capital
      of Bolivar, a city independent from any of the warring factions. It is a
      major economic and tourist hub for the region of the world, and does
      business with all three factions. As such, it is treated as a neutral
      ground, and left well enough alone.</p><p>Life in Bolivar can be
      drastically different depending on where one lives. The civil war is very
      much ongoing, with territory being gained and lost alongside the lives
      used to fight for them. As anyone who has experienced war knows, it is
      never just the soldiers who suffer. Even in cities where the fighting has
      strayed from at present, the weak influence of either of the official
      governments means that lawlessness is the norm.</p><p>The True Bolivarian
      territories are no better for another reason, as iron-fisted authoritarian
      rule traps its citizens in a life of fear. While the True Bolivarians have
      an organised chain of command, differing ideologies amongst the junta
      means that corruption is commonplace, leading to wanton destruction and
      looting that often goes unpunished.</p><p>Dossoles is, on the surface,
      free from the conflict. It is a city with a veneer of glitz and glamour,
      and politically neutral. Beneath the gloss however, all three warring
      factions in Bolivar have their fingers in the pie. The conflict is alive
      and well in Dossoles, but it is not fought with weapons.</p><p>The
      international perception of Bolivar is that of a poor, war-torn nation,
      but despite it all, Bolivar still retains a vibrant culture. As one of
      Terra’s first colonies, and the subject of the first colonial boom, almost
      every culture from across the world has blended in Bolivar. The war and
      its impact on education has meant that many Bolivarians are illiterate,
      but almost every Bolivarian can speak three or more languages fluently;
      all the better to enjoy the energetic music and dance the nation is known
      for.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>As a
      nation founded on the mining of Originium, Oripathy is not at all
      uncommon. The prospects for Infected within Bolivar are poor; while not
      legally discriminated against by the State, they very much face social
      discrimination. As a result, they are often forced to live in slums with
      similarly downtrodden people. Furthermore, thanks to the wartorn nation of
      Bolivar, medical aid for the Infected is few and far
      between.</p></blockquote><h1>Bolivarian
