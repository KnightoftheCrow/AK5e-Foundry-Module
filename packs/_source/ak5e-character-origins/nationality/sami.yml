      <p>Sami is not a nation in the conventional sense. It is a loose
      confederation of hundreds of individual tribes that dwell in the same
      region, and share a cultural heritage. Living in harmony with nature
      rather than in spite of it, the Samifjod have battled against the
      incursions of the northern Collapsals, known to them as Andskotarnir, or
      Demons, for longer than many nations have existed. They are a complex but
      primitive folk, often maligned by more “civilized” folk as simple
      tribes-people.</p><p>Each individual tribe is ruled by a Chieftain and/or
      a Snowpriest, the latter of which is also responsible for interpreting the
      will of the land of Sami and its guardian Samivillin. It is rare that any
      two tribes will join together beyond a passing meeting or trade, and
      typically only occurs when multiple Snowpriests have received the same
      signs to discuss what that might mean.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The
      Infected Question</strong></p><p>Thanks to its almost complete lack of
      industry and production, Oripathy in Sami is rare. Cases mostly occur due
      to Catastrophes or storms stirring up particulate matter from the Kollosal
      Originium Prime vein, which is more common the more northerly you
      are.</p><p>The response to Oripathy can vary tribe by tribe, but generally
      speaking, while they are not exiled, they begin to exist on the fringes of
      the tribe rather than within it, acting as messengers or hunters.
      Treatment for Oripathy essentially only exists in natural, holistic
      methods; though the influx of Columbian culture means this may change in
      future.</p></blockquote><p>Sami is divided into four regions, which
      roughly define the types of people that live there.</p><p>Southern Sami is
      cold bog and peatland, difficult to traverse on foot; as a result, the
      southern tribes get around mostly using boats. It is the mostly densely
      populated region of Sami, both in terms of natives and foreign
      outposts.</p><p>Central Sami is a great forest known as the Myrkwood,
      which is sacred to the Samifjod; the clans that live here worship its
      grandest trees, known as Clan Trees, and often build their homes on or
      around them.</p><p>Beyond the Myrkwood is a vast tundra until reaching the
      Fjal Vetrtonn mountain range; almost no-one makes their homes here due to
      the terrain, but especially in recent years as Collapsal pollution makes
      the area dangerous to both body and mind.</p><p>Beyond even the Fjal
      Vetrtonn is the Infy Ice-field, a mostly unexplored region of Terra that
      precious few have ever returned from. There is a singular passage from the
      tundra to the ice-field, and this is guarded by the Stuoraveahka; elite
      warriors from all over Sami who dedicated themselves to its defence, and
      the Cyclopes of the Sarkaz.</p><p>The Samifjod believe that Sami lies on
      the body of their God, Samivillin, who was wounded defending humanity from
      a flying monster called Valrhivta. Valrhivta is responsible for the storms
      that plague Sami, and its eggs drew the original ire of the Collapsals.
      Samivillin lies hibernating until its strength has returned, and it bid
      its children to keep Sami safe until then. Before entering hibernation,
      however, it is said that Samivillin created Amma, the ancestral spirit of
      Sami. Amma cannot commune through words as Samivillin could, and must
      communicate through nature, such as through fire and in ice. Interpreting
      these messages gave rise to the first Snowpriests. When the Cyclopes came
      to Sami to help in their battle against the demons, they shared with the
      Samifjod their gift of divination, teaching them to read runes found in
      bark to aid their divination, and communion with Amma.</p><p>All of this
      compounds into the beliefs of the Samifjod, a form of animism. To them,
      everything in nature has a spirit worthy of respect, and thus they should
      try to disturb the natural order as little as possible. The natural order
      to them is that of the Eternal Hunt; everything is either hunter or
      hunted. When the hunter consumes the hunted, their spirits can commune and
      become something more. As such, despite the dangerous wildlife of Sami,
      the Samifjod choose to be the hunter, leading to their hunter/gatherer
      culture in lieu of agriculture.</p><p>In the modern age, Sami’s situation
      has been complicated by outside influence. Ursus and the Samifjod have
      been engaging in border skirmishes for over a century, though neither side
      perceive it as a war; simply a dispute over territory. Ursus wants greater
      access to the Kollosal Prime Vein, one of the largest Originium Veins on
      Terra, which is found under a significant amount of Sami, and Sami simply
      does not want to give up the land. On the diplomatic side, Columbia and
      Victoria have opened dialogue with the Sami tribes to establish trading
      outposts and tourist resorts in the south, and send expeditionary teams to
      the north. This has resulted in the Samifjod becoming exposed to these
      southern cultures and technology, which has had its benefits. However,
      some amongst the Sami fear that the meddling of these southerners weakens
      the defence of the north; the scientific expeditions to study the
      Collapsals may actually be strengthening them, and as Columbia and Ursus
      put more pressure on the Samifjod, they are forced to divert more
      resources south.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Eight
      Taboos</strong></p><p>Sami is a place where the evidence of one’s senses
      cannot necessarily be trusted due to the influence of the Collapsals. Even
      from far beyond the Fjal Vetrtonn, reality itself has a tenuous grip on
      Sami. As such, there are certain things, typically involving learned
      wisdom or natural remedies that must be done that seem unusual to
      outsiders; this is especially prevalent in this modernised age where
      foreign expeditions are not uncommon. The following list of warnings is
      given to all outsiders to Sami, though it is far from the only things they
      need to be concerned about.</p><ol><li><p>Sami has its own reasoning.
      Whenever you feel it is necessary, silently recite this sentence to
      yourself. But if you start questioning Sami, immediately run and leave
      Sami.</p></li><li><p>Sami seems to have no logic at all. Whenever you feel
      the need to doubt, do not hesitate; show your scepticism as you don’t
      understand and comprehend Sami. If you feel confident at a moment when you
      should doubt, immediately run and leave Sami.</p></li><li><p>People who
      speak can generally be trusted. But if you encounter a quiet person or a
      shadow that speaks, immediately run and leave Sami.</p></li><li><p>Respect
      the customs of the locals. Do not touch their clan trees, let alone
      stroking the tree’s shadows. If you do, immediately run and leave
      Sami.</p></li><li><p>On nights when the Twin Moons are dim, do not spend
      your night in the forest. If absolutely necessary, do not spend the night
      with your companions; you must be separated out of each other’s sight. If
      the condition does not allow this or if there is any factor around that
      makes you and your companions afraid of staying alone which brings up the
      mind of “we must not be separated,” immediately run and leave
      Sami.</p></li><li><p>If you notice that your inner thoughts receive verbal
      responses from others, do not answer. Immediately run and leave
      Sami.</p></li><li><p>If you keep these warnings in mind, then when you
      need to recall them, you will understand them eventually. But if you do
      not keep these warnings in mind, immediately run and leave
      Sami.</p></li><li><p>Do not bring back things from Sami that should not be
      brought back. If you do, immediately run and bring it back to
      Sami.</p></li></ol></blockquote><h1>Samifjod
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Samifjod + Ursine + 1 Language
      of your Choice</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Stealth</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Animal
      Handling</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Medicine</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Nature’s Gift):</strong> The people of Sami are tribal, but not
      primitive. Theirs is a society that has developed in harmony with the
      land, not in spite of it.</p><p>You do not gain Exhaustion as a result of
      cold environmental conditions.</p><p>As a Long Rest Activity if you are
      resting in a wooded or forested area, you can forage up enough supplies to
      create a makeshift Medical Kit. This Kit has 3 Charges, a value of 0, and
      will degrade into nothing after a week.</p><p>While Resting, as long as
      you have a fire to cook on, you are treated as if you have a Cooking Kit.
      However, you cannot use the Proficient Uses of this “kit”.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Stuoraveahka):</h3><p>You have dwelled Sami’s northern wastes,
      and battled the demons that pour from the north; an endless tide of
      illusion, misdirection, and death. It has hardened your mind and spirit
      against the predations of the
      Collapsals.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Woodwork Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Demon Hunter):</strong> While you
      are affected by illusion-esque effects and Arts, such as Phantasmal
      Killer, you can end that effect as an Action. Additionally, even if you
      fail a Skill Check to detect an illusion, you will know that something is
      wrong, even if you cannot identify what. Finally, you have Advantage on
      Saving Throws against Aberrations.</p><h3>Unique Background
      (Snowpriest):</h3><p>Given their importance to the Samifjod, Snowpriests
      do not tend to wander much. On occasion, however, a vision or a
      premonition will be so potent as to drive them to leave their post for a
      greater cause.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Pharmacology Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Amma’s Guidance):</strong> As a
      Long Rest Activity, you may divine messages from nature. You may ask a
      question about an action you intend to perform in the next 24 hours (such
      as “crossing the canyon”, “attacking that convoy”, etc); the DM chooses an
      omen for you regarding that action from the following
      table:</p><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Omen</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>For
      results that are likely to
      be</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Weal</p></td><td><p>Good</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Woe</p></td><td><p>Bad</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weal
      and Woe</p></td><td><p>Good and
      Bad</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Indifference</p></td><td><p>Neither Good nor
      Bad</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This should be truthful to the best of
      the DM’s knowledge at the time. If there is a trap in place, then a Woe
      result might be appropriate. If there is no current DM plans for anything
      to go awry, a Weal result might be appropriate. However, this does not
      account for changes in circumstance; something may happen between then and
      now that changes this result; it is merely a prediction, not an accurate
      telling of the future.</p>
