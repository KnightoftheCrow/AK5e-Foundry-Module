      <p>Deep underneath Terra lies a world mostly unseen by those who dwell
      above it- the underground world of the Durin. A vast underground system of
      caves, tunnels, and dangers; these joyful, entrepreneurial folk call it
      their home. The origin of these underground settlements, and the people
      that live there, is the subject of great mystery. However, some amongst
      the Sarkaz believe the Durin to be descended from Dur’akham, an ancient
      Teekaz who led his people into the underground world to escape the
      incursions of The First Civilisation and the Ancients. The truth of this
      will perhaps never be known, as the Durin have long forgotten their own
      origin.</p><p>Regardless, the Durin have been geographically isolated for
      millennia, bearing no desire to explore the surface world. Recently,
      however, a development in their technology caused a change in perspective;
      advanced machinery allowed them to mine directly upwards safely, and to do
      so they created gargantuan lifts to facilitate this operation. In time,
      the surface was only a scant few steps away, and some adventurous Durin
      began to establish contact with the outside
      world.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Infected Durin are relatively uncommon, though the
      incidence rate is increasing as Originium spreads through Terra as a
      consequence to the crystallisation era.</p><p>Discrimination or
      segregation against Infected Durin is essentially non-existent, but nor do
      they have the technology to suppress the condition effectively. Thus, the
      life of an Infected Durin without outside help is likely to be short, but
      free of social pressures.</p></blockquote><p>Each Durin City is a
      City-State governed by a mayor, with crucial decision made through
      referendum. Every citizen’s voice is counted equally, even non-Durin or
      Infected, making it one of, if not the most, equitable place on Terra. The
      Durin cities themselves are great underground domes with features that
      allow them to replicate the surface world, such as a “blue sky” and
      temperature regulation, connected by railways and tunnels. Due to the
      innately peaceful nature of the Durin, there have been almost no wars or
      conflict amongst them, with the very concept of weaponry being foreign to
      some Durin.</p><p>As to be expected for those that live underground, the
      Durin have advanced greatly within the fields of architecture, mining, and
      engineering; all supported by advanced robotics. Durin cities are not
      static edifices; huge sections of the cities are redesigned and rebuilt to
      suit their whims. On rare occasion, if the location of a city becomes too
      dangerous (such as a result of geological instability or Originium Crystal
      incursion, the entire city will recycle what they can and migrate to a new
      location, constructing a new city there. This is an occasion worthy of
      great ceremony in Durin culture, and what remains of the old city will
      often be decorated and adorned as a sort of monument.</p><p>Culturally,
      while Durin are serious about their work, they place high value on leisure
      time. For many, this leisure time is the reason they even work in the
      first place; entire industries are dedicated to the pursuit of leisure. As
      a result, the rare surface dwellers that have visited these cities often
      view them as utopic, but an increasing number of Durin are leaving their
      homes for the surface. Most Durin claim that they are doing so to seek
      excitement away from their idyllic but stale homes, but who knows whether
      that is the whole truth?</p><h1>Durinese
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Durinese + 2 Languages of your
      Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Three
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Tech</p></li><li><p>Arts</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Persuasion</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Joy of Living):</strong> In the cities of Durin, life is to be
      enjoyed. Their paradisaical realms are built to facilitate this pursuit of
      joy. One works so that they may play and party, preferably with alcohol,
      and this fervor for life colours their every interaction.</p><p>If you
      have not rolled Initiative since the last time you completed a Long Rest,
      you have Advantage on Persuasion Checks.</p><p>As a Short Rest Activity,
      if you consume Alcohol and spend that time making merry, you may roll one
      of your Hit Dice and regain Hit Points equal to the amount rolled + your
      Constitution Modifier; this does not consume this Hit Dice.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Durin Engineer):</h3><p>The Durin are master builders and
      engineers; anyone who has had the opportunity to visit any of their
      underground cities could tell you that. Building such a paradise under
      such conditions, with such limitations, is nothing short of genius.
      However, the Durin in charge of these designs and buildings rarely find
      reason to leave the underground, content with their work and lives. If one
      was to leave their domain, however…</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong>
      You are Proficient in the Engineering Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of
      your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Structural
      Knowledge):</strong> If you spend ten minutes studying a Construct or
      Structure, or the plans for one, you learn about its construction,
      relative age, and provenance; enough that you could draw a floorplan of
      the structure. Additionally, for the next 24 hours, Damage dealt by you
      ignores the Resistances of the Construct or Structure you
      studied.</p><p></p><p></p>
