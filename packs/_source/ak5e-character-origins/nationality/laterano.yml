      <p>Formally known as the Lateran City, Laterano is a singular, but highly
      influential city-state bordering Victoria and Iberia. It is the origin and
      the homeland of the Sankta; an overwhelming majority of extant Sankta hail
      from Laterano, even in the increasingly globalised world. Possessed of a
      culture unlike anywhere else on Terra, professed by some to be
      paradisical, Laterano is a place of extreme personal freedom so long as
      they exist within the confines of The Law; a somewhat abstract set of
      teachings interpreted by the clergy of the Lateran Church, the largest
      organised religion on Terra. Despite the absence of a traditional police
      force, and the aforementioned personal freedoms, the crime rate in
      Laterano is extremely low. This is attributed to the Sankta’s “Empathy”,
      which allows them to resolve conflict easily as there can be no
      misunderstanding around a person’s feelings on a matter. Such are their
      powers of conflict resolution amongst themselves, that there is a popular
      proverb that covers it; “Duae halos satis sunt omnes conflictus resolvere.
      (Two halos are sufficient to resolve all conflicts).”</p><p>The true
      origin of the Sankta, and thus, Laterano, is different to the widely
      publicised answer, teaching that the first Saints founded Laterano after
      being hunted nearly to extinction by the Sarkaz.</p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>“During the day,</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>The Sankta looked up at the sky to find
      darkness shrouding even the sun. At night, the devil’s army came and
      slaughtered countless Sankta. The Sankta lost much of their
      radiance.</em></p><p style="text-align:center"><em>“The saints said:
      follow me. Thus they rose.</em></p><p style="text-align:center"><em>The
      saints said: listen to me. Thus, the bells began to ring.</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>“The bells echoed throughout the wilderness,
      uniting all the Sankta.</em></p><p style="text-align:center"><em>“This is
      a revelation. This is an exhortation.</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>“There will be light throughout the day, and
      it shall never be shrouded again.</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>“The saints said: build a city. It will be
      the Sankta’s paradise.</em></p><p style="text-align:center"><em>“The
      saints said: this city shall be called Lateran.”</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em><strong>First Chapter of the Lateran
      Scripture</strong></em></p><p>The truth, however, is that there originally
      were no Sankta; those who would become Sankta were Sarkaz (or Teekaz, as
      they were then) themselves. They sought for a way to preserve their
      civilisation against the incursions of the Ancient Races, and while
      digging through forbidden ruins, came face to face with The Law, an alien,
      incredibly powerful supercomputer with the ability to manipulate reality
      itself. It offered salvation to that lost people, and when they accepted,
      warped those Sarkaz into the Sankta, granting them their Halo and Empathy.
      It was these new Sankta that settled Laterano around The Law. They later
      came into conflict with the Sarkaz, as the Ancients not only spared the
      Sankta, but accepted them into their ranks. This is known as The Betrayal,
      and is the root cause for the millennia of racial tension between the
      Sarkaz and Sankta, even if few actually know the
      reason.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Law/Lateran Faith</strong></p><p>The
      Law and the Lateran Faith is difficult to understand, but is important to
      playing almost any Lateran character. “The Law” refers to both the rules
      and regulations set out by the Lateran Church, and also the machine entity
      responsible for passing down these rules and regulations; the main
      responsibility of the Pope is to interpret the Law’s teaching and pass
      them into legal law. While they may refer to The Law as “Lord” or “God”,
      it is not a creator god nor a philosophical concept, but a physical being.
      However, almost every Sankta does not know the truth of what The Law is;
      only the current Pope and a select few are permitted to view it or have
      audience with it, conducted through a screen. The proof of The Law’s
      influence is the halo and wings that are characteristic of the Sankta,
      along with their sixth sense of Empathy.</p><p>Laterano’s unique social
      structure is the result of teachings passed down by The Law, and the
      Church states that it is Empathy which allows them to intrinsically
      understand these teachings. Thus, while non-Sankta can hold positions in
      the Faith, the Papal position is reserved for
      Sankta.</p></blockquote><p>Since then, the Sankta have taken great pains
      to free themselves from the truth of their origin, even (allegedly) going
      so far as to assassinate archeologists that uncovered evidence of it. Up
      until this day, Lateran culture still holds extreme prejudice towards the
      Sarkaz and Kazdel, as the Sarkaz are the only Terrans to not be permitted
      access to the Holy City. The current Pope, Yvangelista XI, holds no such
      feelings of animosity towards the Sarkaz, but believes that such things
      are now impossible to change.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Firearms and
      Laterano</strong></p><p>Laterano has had until recently, an unchallenged
      monopoly on Terra’s firearms industry. They were the first to discover
      firearms as a result of The Law’s guidance, though these are not firearms
      in the sense of real-world guns, as gunpowder cannot be manufactured on
      Terra; Terran firearms and their ammunition are instead operated, like
      almost everything else, through Originium Arts. In essence, Terran
      Firearms are Arts Units that are specialised to deliver the wielder’s Arts
      to the bullets, which do not have a conventional primer but an
      Originium-based primer that produces the prerequisite explosion to
      accelerate the ammunition. For this reason, Terran Firearms are not simple
      to operate unlike conventional firearms, requiring either talents and
      training or the natural Arts precision of the Sankta. The Sankta see
      firearms as the ultimate expression of The Law; raw violence restrained
      and controlled through order and discipline, employed when and where
      they’re required. Thus do firearms feature heavily in their religious
      imagery and celebrations. Explosives, and Launchers however, do not
      require the fine Arts control of firearms, and are thus the preferred
      weapon of many non-Sankta Laterans.</p></blockquote><p>As of the age of
      12, all Lateran Sankta are entitled to own a Patron Firearm given to them
      by the Notarial Hall, though they must undergo training in its use for the
      next four years. At the end of these years, they are required to pass a
      permit test to formally register ownership and the right to bear it.
      Assuming they pass, they must check in yearly with the Notarial Hall for
      maintenance and permit renewal. Upon a Sankta’s death, their firearm is
      retrieved by Executors to be handed out again in future.</p><p>Guided by
      The Law’s teaching, Laterano has the most generous social welfare on
      Terra; free education at all levels (those outside the cities often
      receive their education in monasteries or through roaming teachers), free
      healthcare, and property insurance. These welfares are given to all
      citizens of Laterano, and any non-Sarkaz foreigner is welcome to apply for
      Lateran citizenship through the Curia. While non-Sankta are guaranteed
      fair legal treatment during all proceedings, there is a darker edge to a
      society primarily run by people who can understand each other’s feelings
      inherently; if you cannot do the same, there is an automatic social
      barrier between you. While it is not malicious, the Sankta Laterans tend
      to look down upon those without “Empathy”, and often (though usually
      unintentionally) exclude non-Sankta from their discussions, as much of
      Sankta-Sankta communication is non-verbal. As a result, there is a social
      segregation between Sankta Laterans and those of others species, leading
      to a certain degree of tension especially amongst the Liberi faithful, who
      were the first immigrants to the Holy City and hold many high positions
      within both the nation and the church.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The
      Infected Question</strong></p><p>Laterano’s stance on Oripathy sufferers
      is simultaneously draconian and considerate. Every citizen of Laterano is
      required to have regular medical checkups, which includes monitoring for
      Oripathy. Anyone found with the condition is exiled permanently from the
      nation, but still retain all of their citizenship
      rights.</p></blockquote><h1>Lateran

      from:</p><ul><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Investigation</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Tech</p></li><li><p>Arts</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (The Thirteen Rights):</strong> Lateran Citizens are entitled to
      their rights, even abroad, so long as they do not do something to
      permanently estrange themselves from Laterano.</p><p>The Executors of the
      Notarial Hall enforce these rights even for Sankta abroad, and will do so
      for you if you call upon them. They cannot act on things they do not know
      about, and if you abuse their protection, they may disavow you.</p><p>When
      the Executors are dispatched, they are deployed in teams of 1-3. They are
      heavily armed, but are not there to cause violence if it can be avoided;
      they are essentially gun-toting lawyers. Their only focus is to ensure
      your rights, and so while they will not be actively hostile to
      non-Laterans, they will not care about them if not necessary. They also
      will not throw their lives away; if a situation is too much for them to
      handle, they will retreat and reassess the
      situation.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Thirteen
      Rights</strong></p><ol><li><p>All Lateran Citizens are born free and
      equal, and should act towards each other as such.</p></li><li><p>All

      (Pathfinder)</h3><p>The Pathfinders are a heretical organisation that
      seeks to end the isolationism of Laterano and bring aid to the unfortunate
      of the world, rather than promising heaven. They accept all faithful,
      including Sarkaz. They find their own path, and refuse to follow the path
      laid out for them.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in two Tools/Vehicles of your choice.</p><p><strong>Background
      Feat (Find the Path):</strong> You lose all Skill Proficiencies from your
      Species and Nationality, and cannot gain any Skill Proficiencies. Instead,
      you have Proficiency Points; you start off with 3 at Level 1, and gain 1
      every Level thereafter. You invest these points into your Skills when you
      get them; each one you invest gives you a +1 Bonus to Skill Checks and
      your Passive Score using that Skill. The maximum points you can have
      invested into a Skill is equal to your Character Level +3.</p><p>If you
      would gain a Skill Proficiency from a different source, such as from your
      Class, you instead gain 1 Proficiency Point; if you would gain Expertise
      in a Skill, you instead gain 3 Proficiency Points.</p><p>You are
      considered Proficient in any Skill you have Proficiency Points invested
      in. If the amount of points you have invested in a Skill is greater than
      your Proficiency Bonus, you are considered to have Expertise in that
      Skill.</p><h3><strong>Unique Background (Pontifica Cohors
      Lateran)</strong></h3><p>The Cohors Lateran are one of two military arms
      of Laterano, and are primarily responsible for defending Laterano and its
      citizens, and securing Lateran interests. The other side is the Apostolic
      Knights, who occupy a more offensive-orientated
      niche.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Legion of Heaven):</strong> If
      another Creature you can see is hit by an Attack, you can expend your
      Reaction to choose a weapon you are wielding. If the attacked Creature is
      within the Reach or the Normal Range for that weapon, you can make an
      Attack Roll using it; if the result of that Attack Roll is equal to or
      greater than the result of triggering Attack, the triggering Attack misses
      the attacked Creature.</p><p>Once you have used this Feature, you must
      complete a Short or Long Rest before you can do so again.</p><p></p>
