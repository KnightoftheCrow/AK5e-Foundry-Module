      <p>Yan, formally called Great Yan, is one of two Terran superpowers that
      do not occupy the central heartland, instead being found in the east. It
      is a gargantuan place, comparable even to mighty Ursus, and has an equally
      large bureaucracy to match; while it is an empire, it is not feudal like
      many others, instead having a stratified system of government responsible
      for the entire nation. It has a rich, ancient culture that is traditional
      without being inflexible, and has adapted to the vagaries of the modern
      age without too much difficulty. Great Yan is, and has always been, a
      place of racial acceptance; those who serve Yan are tongxiang
      (countrymen). This acceptance has led to them becoming diplomats and
      mediators in the modern era.</p><p>Yan, along with Sargon, is one of the
      oldest still extant nations on Terra. It was formed from the “Hundred
      Clans” by a warlord known as Yan, who would give his name to the region.
      In this ancient era, Feranmuts still openly roamed the lands, especially
      in the fertile lands of Yan, and the people worshipped and feared them as
      divine beings. However, an expedition led by the man who would later
      become the first Emperor discovered the bones of dead Feranmuts, proving
      that they were indeed mortal, and could perhaps be killed. Eventually,
      this lead to an event known as The Grand Hunt, where the people of Yan
      would carry out a campaign against the Feranmuts, killing many and driving
      more from their land.</p><p>For millennia following the Grand Hunt, Yan’s
      distance from the heartland of Terra resulted in it being mostly absent
      from conflict in the region. Its rich and fertile land allowed it to grow
      in isolation, though it impressed political influence on other eastern
      nations such as Higashi, mediating in their longstanding civil war. Upon
      the dawn of the industrial revolution, the then Emperor decided that Yan
      could no longer remain by itself, and opened up diplomatic and economic
      relations with the Terran heartland, who were grateful for the new trade
      opportunities provided by Yan. Cities closest to the heartland such as
      Lungmen profited so drastically that they are almost city-states unto
      themselves, though still owing allegiance to greater
      Yan.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>Yanese
      treatment of Infected mirrors many nations in that their freedom of
      mobility is strictly curtailed, only able to move from region to region
      with the express permission of The Ministry of Personnel. Beyond this,
      they are normal citizens of Yan, including being responsible for their own
      healthcare. This is well enough achieved in urban Yan; less so for those
      in rural locations, especially the northern folk who experience frequent
      Catastrophes.</p></blockquote><p>an is a wide, vast land, with differing
      climate and geography in its various regions. The centre of the nation,
      between the two rivers that course through Yan, has become the industrial
      heartland of the nation thanks to those very rivers, as well as its
      proximity to the Jingyu Prime Originium vein.</p><p>South of the rivers is
      humid and wet, and is the seat of much of Yan’s agriculture, as well as a
      majority of its 300 million population.</p><p>North of the rivers is the
      relatively barren Saibei region, where a majority of military activity
      takes place due to incursions by northern Collapsals.</p><p>Yanese culture
      can differ strongly between north and south, especially when it comes to
      cuisine. Festivals play a great part in Yanese culture, and typically
      involve fireworks which are, technically, miniature Arts Wands.
      Traditional Yanese literature and boardgames are popular all over the
      country, and are enjoyed by people of all social classes.</p><p>As stated,
      Great Yan is an empire, with its head of state being the Zhenlong/True
      Long, often translated as Emperor. The Emperor holds supreme executive
      power, but is advised by his cabinet, made of three “Grand Dukes”; the
      Grand Secretariat, Grand Tutor, and Grand Commandant, responsible for
      statecraft, education, and defence respectively. These Grand Dukes speak
      with the Emperor’s authority, and assist him in governing the realm.
      Beneath the three Grand Dukes are the Six Ministries; these Ministries are
      the main organisations that run Yan on a day-to-day basis. Anyone, noble
      or commoner, can become a minister, but to do so they must pass an
      entrance exam; as such, education is considered highly important to Yan,
      and roaming teachers attempt to spread education to more rural
      areas.</p><p>In cities all over Yan, life is not too dissimilar to urban
      life across Terra; the industrial revolution found a home in Yan as it did
      many other places, and Yanese cities are as much a concrete jungle as any
      other region. However, perhaps because of its centralised nature, Yanese
      architecture and design has a distinct style, honouring the ethos of its
      ancient culture even in modern construction.</p><p>In rural Yan, a
      majority of settlements fall into two categories; trading posts/rest
      stops, and agricultural hubs. The people of rural Yan are technologically
      undeveloped when compared to urban Yan, but they are not as far removed
      from the industrial age as Sargonian tribes-people; most have heard of and
      may even own some Originium technology, but things such as electricity are
      not common household utilities. This is likely to change in the near
      future; the nation is currently pouring funding into research to
      revolutionise agriculture into a more scientific endeavour, creating
      mobile hydroponics facilities which would change the fates of many Yanese,
      for better or worse.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Six Ministries of

      Feat (Wide, Vast Land):</strong> Yan is a massive nation; the most
      populated nation on Terra, to be precise. The Yanese are not comprised of
      one or two predominant species, but many; especially in places like
      Lungmen, the mixing of culture, race, heritage, and creed is unlike any
      other.The people of Yan choose not to think of others as members of their
      species, as many other places in Terra would, but instead as fellow
      countrymen. As a result, they have developed a certain talent for
      smoothing over disagreements and closing deals.</p><p>You have Advantage
      on Persuasion or Intimidation Skill Checks during negotiations between two
      or more parties that you are not part of (you may negotiate on behalf of
      one of these parties but you may not use it for the direct benefit of a
      conversation that you are the main beneficiary of). Once per Long Rest,
      you may roll 1d6 and add it to the result of one Persuasion or
      Intimidation Skill Check during a negotiation like this.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Martial Arts Practitioner)</h3><p>There are a great number of
      schools of Martial Arts in Yan; some are commercialised, teaching self
      defence to the masses and hosting publicised tournaments, while others are
      traditional, holding to the idea that Martial Arts are a tool for
      preserving peace, first and
      foremost.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Art Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Wuxia):</strong> Whichever

      the Shove Action against that Creature as a Bonus Action. You may use this

      uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
