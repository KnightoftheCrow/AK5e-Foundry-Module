      <p>Siracusa is a confederation of twenty-two autonomous cities under the
      de facto leadership of twelve mafia families, the Dodici Famiglie. While
      it is not a place without laws, it is still a lawless place, as the
      judicial system has little to no power over the families; unless they
      overstep the boundaries laid out by Signora Sicilia, the rarely seen but
      highly influential head of state, and founder of the modern Siracusa. It
      is a place where everything is controlled by the mafias, and the line
      between civilian and mafia is dangerously blurred at times. Siracusa’s
      frequent rains clean away the spilled blood, but the rain cannot cleanse
      the marks on the soul.</p><p>A vast majority of Siracusa’s populace are
      Lupo, with a decent sub-populace of Vulpo. The Lupo have dwelled in this
      region since the tribal era, living in small family units; eventually
      these prehistoric Lupo came into contact with the predatory Beastlords,
      the Signori del Lupi. To survive, those families banded together into the
      first regional tribes, and established a strict hierarchy within these
      tribes based on power; social or physical. These tribes were the basis of
      what would become the Famiglie; bound by blood, both theirs and others,
      but constantly in contest with one another.</p><p>Later, the tribes of
      Siracusa would join hands with Leithanien, becoming the 10th Kreis
      (province) of what would become Leithanien. This arrangement did not last,
      however, and after being mistreated for centuries by the Leithaniens, the
      Siracusans sought independence. After a period of great unrest, in 979,
      the newly ascended Witch King granted them the independence they
      sought.</p><p>For 70 years after obtaining independence, the Famiglia
      openly struggled with each-other to establish dominance, with anarchy
      ruling the streets. The anarchy was quelled by the return of Signora
      Sicilia, head of the prestigious Sicilia Famiglia, from studies in
      Laterano. She brought with her the Lateran faith, and a doctrine that
      still holds today; “Pistole e Ordine,” the “Guns and Order.” Through
      political machination and violence, she quelled the Famiglia and
      introduced her Guns and Order. The concept behind Guns and Order is
      violence to end all violence, and an order established through the threat
      of this violence. To the Famiglia, this means that they are relatively
      free to do what they please, so long as they do not overstep the mark, and
      bring this violence down upon themselves. Her ironclad law is that no open
      warfare must occur between the Famiglia.</p><p>For the average person, in
      theory, this means that they are relatively safe, so long as they obey the
      Famiglia; the Famiglia protect their own and reward service. In practice,
      however, many people often find their loyalties torn between several
      Famiglia, or find their morals in contrast to their Famiglie loyalties.
      There is no question that involvement with the Famiglia is dangerous, but
      for many Siracusans, they feel there is no other
      choice.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Healthcare in Siracusa is divided into public and
      private, with the latter being controlled by the Families. The care is
      generally better in the private hospitals, though not for lack of effort
      by public medical staff; they are simply better funded. Of course, if you
      have done anything to upset the Family in charge of that hospital, you
      likely won’t be admitted.</p><p>Regardless, Siracusa has several notable
      medical academies (such as Palermo) despite its small landmass. It does
      not actively discriminate against Infected in the same way that other
      nations do, but they are treated as sufferers of a terminal, potentially
      infectious disease. As such, many are confined to Intensive Care Wards,
      though people in early stages of infection may be treated as an
      outpatient.</p></blockquote><p>The Famiglie, however, are not Siracusa’s
      de jure government. The Confederate Council of Siracusa is a governmental
      organisation run by non-Famiglie, responsible for transport, public works,
      commerce, etc. They are elected representatives, and the internally
      elected Confederate Chancellor is the de jure head of state for Siracusa.
      The de facto government, however, is the Grey Hall; established by Signora
      Sicilia as a neutral place of diplomacy for the Dodici Famiglie, the
      Twelve Families. Here is where a majority of decisions for Siracusa are
      actually made, and schemes plotted, all to maintain Guns and Order.</p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>The government is just the cloth draped over
      Grey Hall’s round table.</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em><strong>Signora
      Sicilia</strong></em></p><p>All in all, Siracusa is incredibly, wilfully
      corrupt, with almost everything controlled by the Famiglia either directly
      or indirectly. They are even mostly exempt from the judicial system; there
      are no police in Siracusa, but judges have the right and responsibility to
      uphold the law, and are armed to do so. However, even they cannot
      interfere in Famiglie affairs unless civilians are imperiled. Despite its
      lawless nature, life goes on in Siracusa; underneath the fear and the
      violence, there is a bizarre order to things, especially for those not
      directly involved in Famiglie business. Thanks to its longstanding culture
      of service to others, it has developed thriving industries in cuisine,
      cosmetics, film, and healthcare. In particular, Siracusans take their
      national cuisine extremely seriously, having once almost caused a
      diplomatic incident over it. This culture of servitude and submission has
      its negative aspects too, however; most children are taught to always obey
      their parents no matter what, and as a result it is rare for a Siracusan
      to break away from their family even after experiencing
      abuse.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Lateran
      Faith</strong></p><p>Alongside Iberia, Siracusa is the other non-Lateran
      nation to be heavily influenced by the Lateran Church and its religion.
      Much like Iberia, however, the doctrine of the Siracusan faith and the
      Lateran Faith differs greatly. While the Laterans worship “The Law”, the
      Siracusans worship Order, and this order is achieved through Signora
      Sicilia’s Guns and Order. As a result, while Lateran Clergy are typically
      armed, they preach peace; Siracusan Clergy, on the other hand, are not
      above using violence to achieve repentance and maintain order. This faith
      is extremely strong in Siracusa, and most children are raised believing in
      it, even if they later question those
      beliefs.</p></blockquote><h1>Siracusan
