      <p>Siesta is an independent nomadic city-state that can mostly be found on
      the coastline of the Sea of Clariside, an inland sea that became a bay
      during the Profound Silence. It is nominally a commonwealth of Columbia,
      but maintains complete autonomy as of the turn of the 12th century,
      despite intense political pressure from Columbia and Victoria. It is famed
      internationally as a desirable tourist destination, but for the people
      that live there, it is a melting pot of almost every Terran culture, with
      an internationally beloved culture of music and dance. To be Siestan is to
      be submerged in all the cultures of the world a small amount.</p><p>Siesta
      did not begin independent. Originally established as a trading post by
      Columbian pioneers, it was built on the site of a long abandoned Sargonic
      great road, from the heartlands down to the Iberian coasts. Columbia
      intended to reopen this old route to trade with the Iberians, who were at
      the height of their power. With the aid of the Columbian Army, the trading
      town of Siesta was established, and named for the Iberian word for
      “afternoon nap”, to represent its low Catastrophe
      rate.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Siesta’s handling of Oripathy is very relaxed when
      compared to some states. It does not legally discriminate against them,
      and Siesta’s open minded culture means that they are typically treated
      well. Furthermore, an Infected Treatment Centre developed in partnership
      with Rhodes Island has recently opened within the city, designed to ensure
      Infected can access the treatment they need.</p><p>However, as it is still
      nominally a Columbian commonwealth, the Columbian government has been
      pressuring the Siestan council to implement a number of Columbian laws,
      including its medical insurance premiums that are placed upon Infected,
      which results in many becoming bankrupt. The Siestans have not yet moved
      an inch, but who knows what the future holds?</p></blockquote><p>When the
      Profound Silence decimated Iberia, all trade to and from Iberia stopped
      practically overnight. A majority of Iberia’s major settlements, including
      the capital, were destroyed, along with most of the nation’s industry.
      Civil order disintegrated in what was left of Iberia, and no-one could buy
      the Columbian goods. The Columbian Army, citing a lack of strategic value,
      withdrew from Siesta. In the years to come, while they would attempt to
      return, their failure in the Bolivar Campaign led to congress keeping them
      on a short leash, and thus the Siestans were left on their
      own.</p><p>Thus, they developed independent of any other nation, taking in
      wave after wave of immigrants and refugees from all over Terra; it was
      these myriad cultures that gave rise to the vibrant Siestan culture seen
      today. With its beautiful beaches, open and accepting culture, and
      extremely profitable obsidian mining industry, Siesta established itself
      as an independent power not tied to any one nation.</p><p>In 1097, the
      long dormant Mount Siesta began to show signs of activity due to obsidian
      mining, and plans were made to relocate the citizens into a nomadic “New
      Siesta”. In 1099, the expected eruption occurred, and what was once Siesta
      was buried under ash and rubble. New Siesta maintains the spirit and soul
      of the old city, travelling around the beaches of the Sea of Clariside.
      With outside investment, it has fashioned itself into an important
      international trading hub as well as a tourist destination, reprising its
      original role from all those years ago.</p><p>Siesta is famous for its
      personal freedom and open culture, accepting of all people and species.
      The amalgam culture of Siesta continues to grow and develop as the years
      advance, with more and more people moving to the growing financial hub to
      seek work or to support the work that is already there.</p><p>As a tourist
      destination, partying and generally making merry is a typical past-time
      even for natives, typically when accompanied by music; if there is one
      element of Siesta that can be said to be truly Siestan, it is their music.
      Many people play instruments, and many of those will join bands as
      hobbyists. In fact, music is so important to the Siestans that the world’s
      largest music festival, the Obsidian Festival, in held within Siesta
      annually.</p><h1>Siestan Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong>
