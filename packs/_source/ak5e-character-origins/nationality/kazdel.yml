      <p>Kazdel; the promised land, the home that was, and shall be. Kazdel,
      once named Teekaz for the people who built their first settlement there.
      Kazdel, a place reduced to rubble countless times, and yet rising again
      each time. Kazdel is not just a city, but a concept, an idea that means
      something different to every Sarkaz that would call it home.</p><p>As one
      of the oldest settlements on Terra, summating its millennia of history
      with any degree of integrity is a nigh impossible task, beyond even the
      finest of Terran scholars. What can be collated is its modern history; its
      rebirth into the Kazdel of today. In 898, a crusading force with elements
      from Victoria, Gaul, and Leithanian set out to eradicate the city of
      Kazdel once more. In some ways, the crusade was a success; the city of
      Kazdel was once more, nought but ash and ruin. History, however, would
      assign the victory, however pyhrric, to the Kazdelians, as the Six Heroes
      of Kazdel put the Crusaders to flight. It was two of these heroes who
      would orchestrate the rebuilding of Kazdel into a modern nomadic city,
      through the combined efforts of all surviving Sarkaz tribes. After painful
      years of effort, the fires of Kazdel’s engines roared into life, fuelled
      by the Soul Furnace and the Revenants that dwelled within it. Great
      factories pumped out smoke into the black air; farmland platforms,
      hospitals, schools, all freshly established. At great effort, Kazdel had
      entered the modern era.</p><p>It has not been smooth sailing since then.
      Kazdel itself has been riven by civil war between the two Heroes who
      rebuilt the city. The death and defeat of one of those heroes at the hands
      of someone close to her ushered in a new era of ultra-nationalism at the
      hands of Regent Theresis and his Military Commission. Life in Kazdel is
      not easy. It is a cramped, polluted place shrouded in smog, through which
      the Soul Furnace casts its infernal radiance, making it uncomfortably warm
      anywhere outside. Mercenaries, soldiers, and worse can be found on every
      street. Yet, despite everything, many Sarkaz are deeply nationalistic, and
      proud of Kazdel. Perhaps, they have good reason to be; it is the one place
      in the world that the Sarkaz are truly welcome, and at the turn of the
      12th Terran Century a period of peace and rebuilding has fell upon Kazdel,
      with a provisional government taking the reigns from the Royal Court for
      the first time since the city’s inception.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The
      Infected Question</strong></p><p>“It’s normal for the Sarkaz to be
      Infected.” is an oft-touted quote that shows an unfortunate reality.
      Kazdel is not a clean place; day and night, great factories plume smog
      over the city, the very city itself is built around an almighty Originium
      crystal in the form of the Soul Furnace. Thus, the people have little
      protection against Oripathy, and the condition is commonplace.</p><p>That
      said, thanks to millennia of experience, the Sarkaz have a number of
      holistic treatments for the condition, to ease an Infected’s suffering;
      their lifespan is still cut tragically short, but it is a marginally less
      fatal condition than in other parts of
      Terra.</p></blockquote><h1>Kazdelian
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Sarkaz + 2 Languages of your
      Choice</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li><li><p>Stealth</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Intimidation</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Trust no-one):</strong> While it seems as if things are changing,
      Kazdel can be a dangerous place to close one’s eyes for noble and commoner
      alike. You’re used to sleeping with “one eye open”, as it
      were.</p><p>While you are sleeping, Attacks against you do not gain
      Advantage, nor do Attacks made against you from within 5 feet
      automatically score a Critical Hit. Additionally, while you are asleep,
      your Passive Perception is increased by 5 for the purpose of causing you
      to wake up if there is potential danger.</p><h3>Unique Background
      (Vagabond):</h3><p>The Sarkaz are familiar as people on the outskirts of
      society, even in their homeland. Your perspective as an outsider allows
      you to see things others might miss.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong>
      You are Proficient in the Cooking Kit or Brewing Kit, and one other
      Tool/Vehicle of your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (The
      Exiled):</strong> If you spend a day within a population centre listening
      in, you can quickly pick up on things like balance of power, pressing
      issues, news, and who is important, even if these things aren’t directly
      stated or talked about. Many people will prefer not to acknowledge you,
      and thus might talk about things as if you weren’t there. However, people
      will tend not to trust you on face value, and will especially not react
      kindly to you snooping about.</p><p>Additionally, you reduce the penalty
      to your Passive Perception for travelling at a Fast Pace or in a Vehicle
      by 5 for yourself only (EG. a -5 becomes 0, a -10 becomes -5).</p>
