      <p>Found in the far north-east of Terra, Higashi is a nation split in
      twain, yet not truly apart. When originally founded, Higashi was a unified
      state known as Ko-ashihara, ruled by the Toukou, descendants of the
      original Empress. However, this unit was not to last, with disagreement on
      succession leading to the nation dividing itself in two; the north ruled
      by the militaristic Kougon, and the south by the entrepreneurial
      Mitsumoto. The period of conflict following this divide is known as the
      North-South War, and lasted for three entire centuries, though the
      conflict heated and cooled countless times over the period.</p><p>At the
      end of this period, with no victor conclusively established, and both
      sides exhausted by generations of conflict, an uneasy peace was signed,
      bringing an end to military action between the two halves of Higashi.
      Non-military conflict, such as defections and sabotage continued until
      1072, where an invasion by the Empire of Ursus forced the two Higashinese
      houses to work together. Together, they dealt the Ursus a crushing blow
      during the Battle of Bloodpeak, bringing a swift end to the war, but not
      without devastating losses of their own. The Kougon in particular had
      suffered greatly, and were forced to rely upon the Mitsumoto. Thus, a
      period of true peace and rebuilding began, mediated by Yanese
      diplomats.</p><p>In the modern day, Higashi is an evolving nation, slowly
      climbing to the centre of the world stage. A majority of its population
      are Oni or Aegir, though as its industry and culture continues to attract
      more migrants, the diaspora has begun to broaden.</p><p>North Higashi is a
      grim, industrial place, with good reason; they face threat from both the
      insidious Seaborn and the corrosive Collapsals. Higashinese Samurai are
      amongst the foremost “Monster Hunters” on Terra, trained and supplied by
      the brutal north.</p><p>By contrast, south Higashi is a rising star in the
      eyes of Terra due to its advanced electronics. This electronic revolution
      has bought forth a pop culture based around visual media such as video
      games and films, many of which depict the Higashinese warrior
      history.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>As
      a place bound by societal convention, almost more so than its legal
      structure, the Infected in Higashi have no legal precedent against
      them.</p><p>However, it is socially expected that they retire from all
      public-facing roles and jobs, instead picking up often dangerous or risky
      jobs in the nation’s developing industry, which itself is contributing to
      a rise in cases. Medical professionals in the nation are ill-equipped to
      treat anything but the symptoms of the condition, and advise those who can
      afford it to instead seek aid from specialist organisations such as Rhodes
      Island.</p></blockquote><h1>Higashinese
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Higashinese + Yanese + 1
      Language of your Choice</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Insight</p></li><li><p>Tech</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Electronic Revolution):</strong> A new sort of technological
      revolution has come from the east, and it flows from
      Higashi.</p><p>Whenever you make a Skill Check to interact with
      electronics, you make that check as if you are Proficient in that Skill.
      If you are already Proficient in that Skill, you make that Check with
      Advantage.</p><h3>Unique Background (Samurai):</h3><p>The Samurai began
      their history as noble retainers, and in the modern age are simply a
      professional military. They protect Higashi from any and all who might
      threaten her.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Bushido Spirit):</strong>
      Higashinese Samurai have battled man and monster for a thousand years,
      proud and potent warriors. It is not easy to put down these
      aspersions.</p><p>You have a special resource called Pride; your maximum
      amount of Pride is two, and you regain all expended Pride when you
      complete a Long Rest. You may spend Pride during your Turn (no Action
      required) to do one of the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Reroll a failed
      Attack Roll; you must use the new result.</p></li><li><p>Move half of your
      Speed directly towards a hostile Creature.</p></li><li><p>Grant yourself
      Advantage on a Saving Throw to resist or end the Frightened
      Condition.</p></li></ul><p>However, if you are defeated, your Pride is
      permanently damaged. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your maximum
      number of Pride is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. When your maximum
      number of Pride is reduced, it cannot be reduced again until you roll
      Initiative.</p><p>You may regain a lost Pride by landing the killing blow
      on a Leader Creature, or by performing a similarly impressive combat feat
      based on GM discretion.</p>
