      <p>Kazimierz is historically a place that has been assailed by foes from
      many sides; the Khaganate, Ursus, Lethanien. It has instilled a fierce
      sense of competition in its people- in their cut-throat world, the choice
      to double down or accept defeat is no choice at all.</p><p>When you lose a
      Check in which your result was opposed to another Creature’s Check (such
      as Stealth vs Perception, or Deception vs Insight), you may use this
      Feature (no Action required) to reroll the result of that Check; each
      Check can only be rerolled in this way once.</p><p>However, if you still
      lose the Check after the reroll, that result is considered to be a
      Critical Fail.</p><p><strong>Partially Automated: </strong>This Feature
      will prompt you when you make a check; there is no way to check if a check
      is opposed, so it will prompt you for each. It will not automatically
      convert the loss into a critical fail.</p>
