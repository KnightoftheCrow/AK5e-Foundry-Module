  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Rim Billiton is a place of heavy industry; almost everyone works in the
      mining industry, or in an industry that supports, or is supported by,
      mining. As such, almost every Rim Billy native learns to use the equipment
      associated with it, but also becomes indoctrinated in the culture that
      surrounds it. Billitonians tend not to care if you’re a Cautus or not, or
      even where you come from at all; as long as you can pull your weight on
      the job, and are up for some fun afterwards, you can be a complete
      stranger.</p><p>When you are performing a manual labour based task
      alongside other Creatures (such as moving cargo, mining, maintaining
      weaponry), you may use the Help Action as a Bonus Action, targeting all
      Creatures that are performing the same task as you. However, you can only
      grant Advantage on Skill Checks using Help in this
      way.</p><p><strong>Automation not required.</strong></p>
