    value: >-
      <p>Under Sargonian occupation, the venerable culture of Minos almost
      crumbled away to nothing, crushed to dust under the world-changing weight
      of imperialism. Now freed from the heel of their oppressors, Minoans have
      restored their culture with a fervor bending on fanaticism, and none will
      ever quash them again. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When
      making a Skill Check to do with playing a Sport, you are considered to be
      Proficient in that Skills. If you are already Proficient, you have
      Advantage on that Check.</p></li><li><p>When you make a Saving Throw to
      avoid or end an effect that would force you to take an Action or Actions
      against your will, you have Advantage on that Saving
      Throw.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cannot be automated.</strong></p>
