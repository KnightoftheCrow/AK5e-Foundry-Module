      <p>Lateran Citizens are entitled to their rights, even abroad, so long as
      they do not do something to permanently estrange themselves from
      Laterano.</p><p>The Executors of the Notarial Hall enforce these rights
      even for Sankta abroad, and will do so for you if you call upon them. They
      cannot act on things they do not know about, and if you abuse their
      protection, they may disavow you.</p><p>When the Executors are dispatched,
      they are deployed in teams of 1-3. They are heavily armed, but are not
      there to cause violence if it can be avoided; they are essentially
      gun-toting lawyers. Their only focus is to ensure your rights, and so
      while they will not be actively hostile to non-Laterans, they will not
      care about them if not necessary. They also will not throw their lives
      away; if a situation is too much for them to handle, they will retreat and
      reassess the situation.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>The Thirteen
      Rights</strong></h3><ol><li><p>All Lateran Citizens are born free and
      equal, and should act towards each other as such.</p></li><li><p>All
      Lateran Citizens have the right to life and safety.</p></li><li><p>No
      Lateran Citizen shall be held in slavery or bondage.</p></li><li><p>No

      cruelty.</p></li><li><p>No Lateran Citizen shall be subject to arbitrary

      are permitted to bear a Patron Firearm</p></li><li><p>All Lateran Citizens
      are entitled to a funeral and recovery of the deceased’s Patron Firearm
      upon death, to be returned to their next of kin.</p></li><li><p>All
      Lateran Citizens are entitled to the essential medical care they require
      to survive in case of injury.</p></li><li><p>All Lateran Citizens are
      entitled to a standard of living adequate for their health and
