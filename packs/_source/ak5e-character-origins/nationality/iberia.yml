      <p>Once the greatest naval power on Terra, the Iberia today is a shell of
      what it once was, and what it could have been. Founded by Liberi
      expatriates from Laterano, for centuries it was a nation of ardent faith
      that shared close ties with Laterano. The Lateran faith and the Iberian
      faith have since diverged following the cataclysmic tsunami known as the
      Profound Silence, with the Iberian faith now a vehicle for the
      Inquisition’s brutal regime.</p><p>Before it was bought to its knees,
      Iberia was a monarchy, led by the Royal House of Iberia, and a major
      contestant for the other superpowers on Terra. In no small part, this was
      due to an influx of Aegir immigrants, dubbed “Islanders” by the Iberians,
      who brought with them their technology. It was the technology of these
      Ægirians that pushed the Iberians to true naval dominance, crushing the
      Victorian fleet, and even beginning construction on the world’s first
      amphibious nomadic cities. This would never come to pass; despite repeated
      warnings from the Islanders about the threat posed by the Seaborn, the
      Royal House saw them as little more than a curiosity.</p><p>In 1038,
      Iberia’s coasts fell silent- no waves, no animals, nothing. Within an
      hour, a tsunami of immeasurable proportions, struck the Iberian coast,
      completely destroying ports and coastal settlements, including the
      then-capital of Ria Iberia. The invincible Iberian armada was sunk, and
      the geography of the Iberian coastline forever changed; the once fertile
      flatlands around the coast are now underwater, leaving only the
      comparatively barren highlands. This event, which became known as the
      Profound Silence, wiped out Iberia’s royal house completely, leaving the
      nation leaderless. In the vacuum, the Iberian Church established the
      Iberian Inquisition to lead what remained of the Iberian people through
      the crisis.</p><p>And yet, the crisis continues. Entire generations have
      been born that do not remember Iberia’s golden age, only living under the
      Inquisition’s oppressive thumb. Anyone suspected of having ties with the
      Seaborn or the Seaborn-worshipping Church of the Deep is dragged away, and
      almost never seen again. Who knows what happens to each; some may be
      forced to join the Penal Battalions, others may simply never leave their
      cell. For Aegir living within Iberia, they have fallen far in reputre
      since the days of the Golden Age, none of it through their own doing.
      Those who remain are seen with superstition and suspicion; such
      persecution often has the effect of encouraging these unfortunates to seek
      ties with the Church of the Deep, who accept them without complaint.
      Despite the generational gap, most Iberians hope against hope for the
      return of their Golden Age- even if they have never seen it. As a result,
      many young Iberians join the Inquisition, to fight for their ideal future,
      and to be a part of the machine rather than under
      it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>Despite
      the intense scrutiny of the Iberian Inquisition, their suspicion does not
      extend to the Infected. This is perhaps because Iberia has a comparatively
      low incidence rate of the disease; little industry survived the Profound
      Silence, and there are no mines to be found.</p><p>If you are unfortunate
      enough to develop Oripathy in Iberia, however, there is little help for
      you to find. More than the most bare-bones of medical care can only be
      found under the Inquisition’s control, and even they are not equipped to
      fight the condition appropriately.</p></blockquote><h1>Iberian

      Feat (Under the Eye):</strong> All those who live in Iberia have lived in
      fear of the Inquisition for at least some of their life. Saying the wrong
      thing is liable to get you hauled away; thus, Iberians possess a talent
      for doublespeak, and solidarity amongst the “little folk”.</p><p>When
      speaking, you know how to say things without implicating anything or
      anyone. You have Advantage on Deception Checks to deny knowledge or
      communicate a hidden message in speech or writing.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Inquisitor):</h3><p>The Iberian Inquistion is an oppressive,
      theocratic regime that has the Iberian people locked tight within its grip
      of fear. This is truth. They are also the only reason the Seaborn have not
      overrun those who remain; this too is
      truth.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Arms of Justice):</strong> As an

      10 feet of you add your Proficiency Bonus to Wisdom Saving Throws they
      make; this effect is not cumulative.</p></li><li><p>Aberration (Seaborn)
