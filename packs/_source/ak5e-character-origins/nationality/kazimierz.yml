      <p>Kazimierz, officially the Kazimierz Alliance or the Przymierze
      Kazimierza lies within Terra’s northern grasslands, bordering such mighty
      nations as Leithanien, Ursus, and Victoria. It is a nation that has been
      conquered on more than one occasion, and yet each time it rises from
      underneath the boot heel and casts off their conquerers. While it began as
      a confederation of feudal knightly orders, modern Kazimierz has drifted to
      a more commerical aspect; yet many of the traditions remain, leading to
      strife between conservative and capitalist elements.</p><p>Established as
      a way for the Kuranta of the plains to defend themselves against
      territorial aggression, the change in Kazimierz has been a gradual one. It
      was once a highly stratified, feudal society. From the mightiest
      knight-lords to chattel slaves (a practice still continued today in some
      places in Kazimierz), everyone had a place; social mobility was extremely
      limited. As the Knights were called away again and again to fight
      aggressors, they were forced to hand over their property to their
      retainers and branch families to maintain; so did much of the wealth leave
      the hands of the knights, passing into these “new money” families who used
      it to establish a solid foothold in the Kazimierzian economy. Over time,
      the newly-emerged merchant class formed the Kazimierzian General Chamber
      of Commerce (KGCC) as a united front, and controlled so much of the
      happenings within the nation that the Knights were forced to seek
      cooperation, creating an uneasy truce.</p><p>Kazimierz’s central
      government is made of three bodies; the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz
      (The Kazimierzian Ministry of Defense and Justice, and the ASK for short),
      the Kazimierzian General Chamber of Commerce (KGCC), and the National
      Council. The National Council represents the judicial and legislative
      power in Kazimierz, and is responsible for maintaining order within the
      nation. However, the official head of state remains the Grand Knight of
      the ASK; in actuality, Kazimierz is under the shadow control of KGCC, who
      control the flow of commerce that the nation now relies
      upon.</p><p>Kazimierz is divided between the Knightly Orders, who value
      the traditions of Kazimierz and control the military of the nation, and
      the Chamber of Commerce, who control the economy of the nation and see the
      aristocrats as stuck in the past. Nowhere is this rivalry more prevalent
      than in discussions surrounding the Knight Competitions. The Kazimierz
      Major, once an event designed for campaigning Knights to hone their skills
      for the battlefield, is now a heavily commercialised competition. Many of
      the competitors in this new style of Major do not belong to a Knightly
      Order at all, and are known as Commercial Knights compared to the old
      guard Campaign Knights. Many Campaign Knights lambast these Commercial
      Knights and their Knightclubs as an affront to national defence, as a
      majority are more akin to sponsored athletes than warriors. On the
      reverse, the KGCC argues that the increasing accessibility of Knighthood
      to those of exceptional skill and talents is a motivating factor for
      Kazimierizians to take an interest in martial matters. It is hard to argue
      that they are wrong about this; there is no doubt that across the nation
      the frequency of amateur “jousts” and those who aspire to be Knights has
      increased.</p><p>Tensions between the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and the KGCC
      are always riding high; while no large scale conflict has broken out,
      there have been a number of skirmishes and stand-offs in the darkened
      corners of the neon cities. For now, Kazimierz remains nominally
      united.</p><p>All this assumes one even lives in the cities of Kazimierz;
      the rural lands of the knightly nation are significantly less developed.
      In these places, agriculture is still the primary industry, mostly for
      their own subsistence, though the KGCC do purchase shares of their crops.
      In some places, this contact with the KGCC is almost all of their contact
      with the world at large, as technology such as radio and television is not
      commonplace. Slowly though, these developments are becoming more common,
      allowing these folk to join in on the excitement and intrigue of the
      Kazimierz Major.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Kazimierzian Infected have it comparatively good-
      on the surface. The state does not actively discriminate against them, and
      even builds mobile platforms for its cities to house them free of charge;
      it does not take a genius to see that these are ghettos in all but name.
      Ultimately, however, many Infected have little choice, as while the state
      may not discriminate, the people are free to, and many Infected will
      struggle to find gainful employment that would allow them to live outside
      of the designated mobile plates.</p><p>Predating on this is the “Infected
      Participation System”, which allows Infected to compete in a special
      Knight Competition league to earn the right to participate with uninfected
      Knights. Many Infected see this, and the wealth and prestige that
      accompanies a successful Knight, as a way out of their position. However,
      the matches fought in this Infected League are often poorly regulated,
      more akin to gladiatorial combat, often no-holds-barred matches against
      beasts and each other. Some of these “Infected Leagues” are even
      falsehoods put on by charlatans as a mere bloodsport, unbeknownst to the
      contestants. Regardless of whether it happens above or below ground, the
      Infected are exploited for entertainment.</p></blockquote><h1>Kazimierzian
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Kazimierzian + Ursine + 1
      Language of your Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Insight</p></li><li><p>Persuasion</p></li><li><p>Performance</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Competitive Spirit):</strong> Kazimierz is historically a place that
      has been assailed by foes from many sides; the Khaganate, Ursus,
      Lethanien. It has instilled a fierce sense of competition in its people-
      in their cut-throat world, the choice to double down or accept defeat is
      no choice at all.</p><p>When you lose a Check in which your result was
      opposed to another Creature’s Check (such as Stealth vs Perception, or
      Deception vs Insight), you may use this Feature (no Action required) to
      reroll the result of that Check; each Check can only be rerolled in this
      way once.</p><p>However, if you still lose the Check after the reroll,
      that result is considered to be a Critical Fail.</p><h3>Unique Background
      (Knight of Kazimierz):</h3><p>You are, or were, part of a Knightly
      organisation. Decide with your GM when you select this background some
      more details about it, and your relationship with them; do you belong to
      an old family, or a knightclub? Are they commercial knights, or campaign
      knights? What is their stance on the Infected? Are you still on good terms
      with them?</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Gallant Demeanour):</strong>
      Regardless of your relationship with them, your time with them has changed
      your demeanour, making you appear reliable and trustworthy. When you
      promise someone that you will do something, you can make them a vow; if
      you do, you gain a +10 bonus to Charisma based Checks against that person,
      as long as it relates to the vow you made, until you either complete your
      vow or break it. You can only have one active vow at a time. If you break
      your vow, it marks your demeanour as much as your honour; the bonus you
      gain from this Feature is permanently reduced by 5, to a minimum of
      0.</p><p>Furthermore, you are Proficient with the Spear and Polearm, and
      you may choose one of these to gain as Starting Equipment.</p>
