      <p>The Leithanien Empire is a confederate elective monarchy bordering
      Ursus, Victoria, Siracusa, and Kazimierz, and is one of five superpowers
      on Terra alongside Victoria, Ursus, Columbia, and Yan; two of which it
      directly borders. As a result, the history of the nation is one of
      political and military jostling as it competes directly and indirectly
      with its neighbours. Where Leithanien is unmatched is in its study of
      Originium Arts, and its music; so entwined are the two that many Arts
      terms that have their root in Leithanien are named using musical terms.
      Arts and their study is so important to Leithanien culture that active
      discrimination against those with weak proficiency for Arts is
      commonplace, referring to them as “defects”.</p><p>Leithanien’s affinity
      with Arts goes all the way back to its very origin as ten warring tribes
      in the region that would become Leithanien. These tribes were eventually
      unified under one of their number, a Caprinae tribe whose name is lost
      possessing powerful oral Arts. This unity did not come with use of arms,
      but with a need to ally against the oncoming Teekaz. The united tribes
      succeeded in their defence, and under the witness of the Sarkaz Lord of
      the Liches of the time, drafted the Güldenesgesatz; an arcane curse and
      constitution in one. It is divided into three acts, and is the most
      complex Art ever witnessed; the first section narrates the foundation of
      Leithanien, the second section marks the borders of the ten Kreise
      (provinces), and the third section implements the secular laws and morals
      every Leithanien should follow. Even today, the very concept of Leithanien
      is under the influence of the Güldenesgesatz, granting it political unity
      even when the nation is unharmonious, as all within Leithanien are
      compelled by it. Such is its presence and power that it can be wielded as
      a weapon; the Gesatzswächters of Leithanien can invoke the Güldenesgesatz
      to cast strange, powerful golden Arts to enforce its order.</p><p>This is
      not without cost, however; if the concept of Leithanien is altered such as
      in the Siracusan separatist movement, or the Güldenesgesatz is not
      reinforced properly such as in the 23rd Kaiserinnenfest, the unravelling
      of the Güldenesgesatz can cause catastrophic psychic pollution, allowing a
      corrosive dimension known as the Void to breach through into reality. The
      Güldenesgesatz can be, and has been, added to over the years, but
      rewriting any section of it has only ever been achieved by two people; the
      Witch King, and Empress Hildegard, which cost the latter her
      life.</p><p>In the modern age, Leithanien is a place in recovery, finding
      its feet again. In 1077 the Witch King, the most powerful Caster in
      Leithanien history, and one of the most powerful casters Terra has ever
      seen, was overthrown by the two who would become the Twin Empresses in a
      grand rebellion known as Die Septemberaufstand. The Witch King’s rule,
      while beginning as an exalted meritocracy, descended into iron fisted
      tyranny for the last thirty years, casting a metaphorical cloud over the
      nation that still remains today. During his time, the Witch King claimed
      much of the power from the nobles of the nation, and with his demise they
      seek to gather their power and establish themselves once again. So it is
      that the class divide is stronger than it has ever been in Leithanien; the
      only hope the common man has to rise beyond his station is through rts or
      music, both of which require academic study. Leithanien has a measure of
      state education, with a basic education provided to all citizens, and free
      access to the highest academies for those with talent or skill. However,
      since the Witch King’s fall, the rate of commoners accepted into these
      academies has fallen from 35% to a measly 7%.</p><p>Music and other forms
      of artistic expression are the very basis of Leithanien culture; almost
      everyone will practice something related to this, at a variety of skill
      levels. To Leithanien culture it is not just something for enjoyment, but
      a way to express ideas, concepts and emotions in their purest form, and
      through them can the nature of life be studied. Thus walking through the
      streets of Leithanien, you can hear music being practised, see painters
      and artists refining their work, and hear the people speaking about the
      latest opera, or their experience at the academies. This all happens under
      the shadow of the Spires; large towers in which the nobility live. The
      Spires are often places of learning as well as dwellings, and many feature
      Arts-amplification technology; during the War of the Four Emperors, Arts
      amplified by these Spires allowed the Leithaniens to repel the Gaulish
      advance. The taller the tower, the more knowledge and prestige held by the
      residing noble. While multi-story buildings are common in other nations,
      in Leithanien only the Spires are allowed to be above a certain height,
      and thus all of Leithanien constantly falls under the shadow of
      nobility.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Thanks to its research into Originium and
      Originium Arts, Leithanien has a better understanding of Oripathy than
      many nations. That is not to say, however, they are necessarily treated
      better than elsewhere. They are not restricted from accessing public
      services, but are forced to live in special quarantine zones. Within these
      zones, the gendarmie are often willing to turn a blind eye, especially if
      the crimes committed are done on behalf of the noble they serve; there
      have been examples of Infected being abducted and used in experimentation
      or worse. Though these events are officially condemned, there is no doubt
      that they still happen.</p></blockquote><h1>Leithanien

      Feat (Sound of Music):</strong> In Leithanien, music, art, and the
      performance of it are more than a virtue; they are core to society itself.
      Learning an instrument as a child is as rudimentary as learning to read
      and write. Leithanien’s fabled Arts often integrate music and sound into
      its casting, the legendary Güldenesgesatz being the archetypal example of
      it.</p><ul><li><p>You gain Proficiency in the Performance

      (Patronaged Prodigy)</h3><p>The upper class of Leithanien are often
      willing to sponsor upcoming talent, to free them from drudgery so that
      they may focus on their art, music, or whatever else they are good at. Of
      course, this is rarely done for altruistic purposes; most just want a hand
      in the development of these talents, to mould them and thus secure their
      own claim to fame.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in either the Art Kit, an Instrument, or the Makeover Kit. In
      addition, you are Proficient in one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Patronage):</strong> Your art,
      whatever it may be, is impressive enough to have attracted attention. You
      have a Patron to support you. They will bankroll you, provide you with
      modest accommodation, spread your works and possibly gain you fame.
      However, if you abuse their patronage or do not produce adequate work, you
      will lose that patronage.</p><p></p>
