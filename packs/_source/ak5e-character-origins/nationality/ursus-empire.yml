      <p>The Empire of Ursus, often just called Ursus (not to be confused with
      the species it takes its name from, Ursus) is a militaristic, xenophobic
      empire occupying much of the Terran north. Its expansionist behaviour has
      given it a reputation as something of an international boogeyman, but
      cultural change is on the rise; a series of devastating losses has allowed
      a new generation of progressives to rise; no less patriotic, but who
      believe Ursus’ value lies in its industry and culture, rather than its
      strength of arms. It is a cold, hard place, oft mirrored by the people who
      live there; but on occasion, warmth can shine through the
      permafrost.</p><p>What would become Ursus began as the Hippogryph Empire,
      who enslaved many species including the Ursus. In the year 31, the
      Hippogryph Empire collapsed internally, and the Ursus rose up from the
      ashes, taking what remained of the old Empire to form the Ursus Empire.
      For almost a millennia, the Ursus Empire reclaimed the old Hippogryph
      lands, including occupying Kazimierz for nearly a century.</p><p>Centuries
      of grinding conflict are acceptable as long as one is reaping the spoils,
      but in the 11th century, the Empire had reached a stalemate with its
      neighbours; the home populace began to express great displeasure at the
      harsh wartime conditions with no demonstrable gain. Seeking a scapegoat,
      the Urusian government pinned the blame on the Infected, passing several
      discriminatory laws to distract the population’s ire.</p><p>This could not
      stop the fall, however, and in 1072 the Empire suffered an embarrassing
      defeat at the hands of the much smaller Higashi, with the Kazimierzians
      breaking free of Ursus occupation that same year. The fallout led to a
      rebellion within the military two years later, a civil war between those
      army elements loyal to the throne and those loyal to the army. The
      royalists were the victors, but the damage inflicted to the Grand Army of
      Ursus crushed any further imperial dreams for the foreseeable
      future.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>The
      situation for Infected in Ursus is perhaps the worst anywhere in Terra,
      with almost all rights stripped from them, especially for those who live
      outside of the cities. Infected are regularly rounded up by Infected
      Patrol Units; those not summarily executed for the slightest disobedience
      are sent to Originium Mines to work as slaves until they die. Within the
      cities, they can generally avoid notice unless their infection is obvious,
      or they are inspected for other reasons. In or out of the cities, Infected
      must rely upon the kindness of others to hide them or access
      treatment.</p><p>The current Emperor and State Council are working slowly
      to reverse this situation for Urusian Infected. However, they face
      opposition at every turn by conservative elements, indoctrinated by
      centuries of anti-Infected policy.</p></blockquote><p>Ursus is an Empire,
      and thus is ruled by an Emperor. Though there are many divisions of power
      below the Emperor, they are at least in theory the supreme executive power
      in the nation. Directly beneath the Emperor is the aristocracy and the
      Ursus State Council. The aristocracy is made from people raised to its
      Level by the Emperor at the time, and their descendants; anyone who
      contributes significantly to Ursus, such as commanders, scientists, and
      industrialists, may be raised to the aristocracy. The State Council is
      made of both nobles recommended by the Emperor and elected
      representatives. They handle the legislation of Ursus and advise the
      Emperor, but all their decisions must be ratified by the
      Emperor.</p><p>Geographically as well as politically, Ursus is gigantic,
      though much of its land is completely undeveloped. A majority of the
      Urusians live in the lowlands in the west and south, where the climate is
      slightly more temperate. The north is mostly frozen tundra thanks to its
      proximity to the Infy Ice-field, and the east is highly mountainous. The
      area of the Empire is divided into governorates, each formed of several
      nomadic cities and stationary settlements. Each governorate is ruled by a
      governor appointed by the Emperor. Each city has its own legal
      jurisdiction, with its own laws and police; however, these courts are not
      free of imperial interference. The military or emperor can legally
      interfere in court proceedings, such as to issue a pardon, but such things
      are rare.</p><p>Life is hard in Ursus, but it is especially true for those
      who live rurally. Even in the cities, poor governance and a land that does
      not lend itself to agriculture can lead to famines; in the rural areas,
      famine is a constant threat. Ursine culture is almost universally related
      to these hard experiences; whether to document them, celebrate surviving
      them, or distract from them; boxing, drinking, and singing folk songs are
      popular past times, each of which lends themself well to the natural
      raucousness and strength of the Ursi. Ursus also has a long history of
      literature and poetry, much of which is as grim as the land in which it
      originates, but often with tones of hope shining through.</p><p>In recent
      years, Ursus has been heavily culturally influenced by Columbian and
      Kazimierzan popular culture. The powers that be in Ursus have taken steps
      to suppress this, and thus those Ursi who want access, typically the
      younger generations, must trade for them using underground markets.
      Culturally, the influence of the military and militarism over Ursus still
      cannot be understated, but the developments of the last century have
      opened the way for a changing political landscape. Not everyone in Ursus
      is pleased about this, however, least of all the military, and the country
      is seemingly forever a bad day away from another rebellion.</p><h1>Urusian
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Ursine + Yanese + 1 Language
      of your Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Investigation</p></li><li><p>Insight</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Intimidation</p></li><li><p>Deception</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Life is Cheap, Friends are Priceless):</strong> Internationally,
      Ursus is something of a boogeyman; a threat breathing down the necks of
      those in the north and centrum of Terra, waiting for an exposed vein to
      strike at. Internally, however, Ursus is a monster eating itself. It is
      all the average person of Ursus can do to bear it; their ears are filled
      with words of hate, words of spite, all you can trust in is your neighbour
      (assuming they’re uninfected, of course), and the cold outside.</p><p>When
      an allied Creature within 10 feet of you is hit by an Attack, you can use
      this Feature as a Reaction; you may immediately move the shortest route to
      interpose yourself between the attacking Creature and the target, or
      otherwise move as close as you can to doing so. If you do so, you become
      the target of that Attack. Furthermore, you are considered to be
      Vulnerable to the Damage of that Attack.</p><h3>Unique Background (Ursus
      Army Veteran):</h3><p>The Imperial Army is gargantuan. It is divided into
      seven armies, and each of these armies is capable of taking on a smaller
      nation. The Third Army was poised to take Lungmen, the Sixth Army fought
      against the combined might of Higashi in the Bloodpeak Campaign. Ursus
      military doctrine favours heavily armoured troops and powerful artillery,
      which has contributed to their international reputation as destructive
      tyrants.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit, and Vehicles (Drones).</p><p><strong>Background Feat
      (Stormtrooper):</strong> As a former soldier of the Ursus Army, you are
      familiar with their chosen tools of war; heavy armour, backed by heavier
      firepower. When the enemy break, they are run down, and the invincible
      army tramples o’er their corpses.</p><ul><li><p>You are Proficient with
      one of the following, and may add one of them to your Starting Equipment;
      Combat Gear, Polearm, Crossbow.</p></li><li><p>Your first Attack each Turn
      against a Creature with the Frightened Condition, or Creatures that are
      not wielding a weapon, deals additional Damage equal to your Proficiency
      Bonus.</p></li></ul>
