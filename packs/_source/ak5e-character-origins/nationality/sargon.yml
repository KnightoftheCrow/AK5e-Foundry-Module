      <p>Sargon is the oldest non-Teekaz civilisation on Terra, and was the
      first superpower, once ruling the Terran heartland. It is an Imperial
      Monarchy that occupies the deserts in the south of Terra, though this was
      not always so. At the zenith of Sargon, much of the region was covered in
      lush jungles extremely conducive to life, allowing the empire to grow
      large with an almost infinite supply of food. A cataclysmic event nearly
      two millennia ago converted these lush jungles into arid desert, forever
      putting an end to the superpower that was Sargon, and leaving the dying
      empire that still clings to life today.</p><p>At the heyday of the Empire
      of Sargon, they faced a two-fold problem; to their south, a vast incursion
      of demons (what would be called Collapsals today) threatened the people
      and the very land with their corruption. To the north, the marauding
      hordes of the Nightzmoran Khaganate were sweeping the world to raid and
      pillage, and had now arrived at Sargon’s door. In an unheard of move, the
      Shah of Sargon befriended the Khan, and the two agreed to band their
      forces together to defeat the demons. They were successful; to this day
      the demons have not been seen again in Sargon.</p><p>Their victory,
      however, came at unimaginable cost. A catastrophic explosion rang from the
      deep south, eradicating the Khaganate, the Shah, and most of their forces.
      Furthermore, most of the lush jungles of Sargon were destroyed, with an
      ever greater amount killed off by the surging heat waves that would begin
      to emerge from this southern area, that would become known as the Foehn
      Hotlands. With the exception of the Acahuallan region, Sargon underwent a
      great desertification. When combined with the eradication of their royal
      line and much of their leadership, Sargon suffered a mortal blow that it
      has never recovered from.</p><p>Sargon’s head of state is the Shahanshah
      (sometimes just called the Shah). The Shah is the de facto leader of the
      nation, but also of every tribe sworn to Sargon’s banner, in addition to
      being the absolute commander of all of Sargon’s armies. These are all
      responsibilities which they naturally cannot carry out alone, and so
      regions of Sargon are ruled by Padishah, who rule a province on behalf of
      the Shah, or by Lords Ameer, who represent a group of tribes in a
      province. These nobles have significant autonomy in the governance of
      their respective areas, so long as they maintain loyalty to the Shah and
      imperial law. As such, it is extremely difficult to enact meaningful
      change over Sargon as a whole, even as the Shah; individual Padishah,
      while they may not directly disobey the Shah, can indirectly disobey them
      or otherwise make the process difficult, if it is not something they
      personally agree with.</p><p>This political squabbling is a large reason
      why Sargon has fallen so far behind in the modern era; a general sense of
      disunity prevails, and so innovation and development takes a long time to
      spread from province to province, if it ever does, as many Padishah are
      loyal to only their own province, and the
      Shah.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected Question</strong></p><p>As
      each individual province has laws unto itself, it is difficult to
      generalise what the experience of being a Sargonian Infected is like.
      There is no imperial law that discriminates against them, but many
      individual provinces choose to segregate their living quarters from
      uninfected individuals. Furthermore, due to the absence of modern
      technology in many regions of Sargon, treatment for Oripathy is extremely
      sparse, and mostly relies on natural methods. Even in the cities, Infected
      care is often subletted to other more specialised
      organisations.</p><p>However, because of Sargon’s lack of industry and
      relatively rare Catastrophe rate, overall Oripathy infection rates are
      low.</p></blockquote><p>Life in Sargon can be very different depending on
      where one lives; even this dilapidated empire covers a vast area.
      Furthermore, Sargon typically does not insist subjugated peoples integrate
      with Sargon, only swear loyalty to the Shah. As a result, many unique
      cultures are preserved in Sargon. In the jungles to the east are a wide
      spread of tribes, from the Acahuallan Archosaurians to the secretive
      Anura. These tribes, while they do have a Lord Ameer, do not have much
      connection with Sargon or even the outside world as a whole. For the
      desert dwellers, it wholly depends on whether one lives in the cities, or
      the villages and tribes. The cities are not too dissimilar from other
      cities on Terra, accounting for differences in climate, with modern
      luxuries and commodities. Notably, however, Sargon has very few nomadic
      cities, as the region is not often struck by Catastrophes. The cities of
      Sargon stand where they stood millennia ago.</p><p>For those that live in
      the villages and tribes, however, many live what might be considered a
      backwards life elsewhere on Terra. For many, Originium technology and the
      advent of the industrial revolution has not reached them. They practice
      subsistence farming, and live difficult but fulfilling lives. It is not
      uncommon to not identify as a Sargonian at all, but instead as a member of
      their tribe due to their narrow world-view. Despite their primitiveness,
      they are not hated or discriminated against by other Sargonians, who view
      them as citizens of Sargon like any other.</p><h1>Sargonian
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Sargonic + 2 Languages of your
      Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Intimidation</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Animal
      Handling</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality Feat (Under the Beating
      Sun):</strong> North of the inhospitable Foehn Hotlands, the deserts of
      Sargon are scarcely better. Visitors to the region find themselves
      withered by the beating heat upon the sands, and exhausted by the effort
      of walking in the unstable desert. The natives have no such
      problem.</p><p>You do not gain Exhaustion as a result of hot environmental
      conditions, and you only need half as much water per day.</p><p>You have
      Advantage on any Saving Throw to avoid being knocked Prone.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Acahualla Tribesman)</h3><p>The tribes-people of Acahualla,
      specifically its Archosaurian inhabitants, are known for their scrappy
      nature. Violence to them is barely a hostile action most of the time; it’s
      just a way to settle disputes like any other contest, nothing to get
      overly upset over. Besides, its fun to brawl and then drink after. Suffice
      to say, even if you’re not an Archosaurian, you’re used to
      it.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Brewing Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Never Counted Out):</strong> Your
      lust for battle and contest fuels you through injury.</p><p>Whenever a
      combat you were involved in ends, you recover missing Hit Points equal to
      your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution Modifier (minimum of
      1).</p><p></p>
