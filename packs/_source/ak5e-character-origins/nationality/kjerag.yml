      <p>Kjerag is a cold, frozen land; but its people are not. While its people
      have always been insular, the xenophobia that plagues many similar places
      has not found root in Kjerag, and they are generally welcoming to
      outsiders, especially those that share their faith. As long as you are
      willing to pull your weight and help out where you can, foreigners can
      generally expect to be welcomed in Kjerag. It is good that it is so, as
      rapid industrial development in the south of the nation, spearheaded by
      the Silverash Clan, has brought an influx of foreigners and foreign
      technology.</p><p>For centuries, Kjerag has been ruled by the Tri-Clan
      Council, a national council assembled from the Patriarch of the three most
      prevalent families in Kjerag; the Silverash, Browntail, and Paleroche
      clans. These meetings are mediated by the Vine-Bear Court, a religious
      order that is the cornerstone of the Cult of Kjeragandr, the principal
      faith in Kjerag, centred around Mount Karlan and its Saintess. The clans
      and tribes are somewhat akin to feudal lords from other realms; they are
      the masters of their own domain, though they do not claim ownership of
      their vassals in the same way other lords might. Until 1097, Kjerag as a
      nation itself was more conceptual than practical; the territory was simply
      divided up between the Clans, and none were subservient to
      another.</p><p>In 1097, a civil war within Kjerag between the progressive
      but Machiavellian Silverash Clan and the other clans of the Tri-Clan
      Council seemed an inevitability, referred to as the “Snowcap Incident”.
      Kickstarted by a Silverash mining operation at the foot of mount Karlan,
      seen as a blasphemy against Kjeragandr, and culminating in the
      assassination of the Great Elder of the Vine Bear Court, soldiers from
      both sides met in the streets, moments from bloodshed. In what has been
      called a miracle, the Karlan Saintess descended from the mountain to put a
      stop to the conflict, and all three clans pledged their allegiance to the
      Saintess, unifying Kjerag under one banner for the first time in history.
      Following this incident, though the three Clans retain much of their
      political power, executive control of the nation has been handed to a
      formal secular parliament led by a speaker, following the Victorian model.
      The Vine-Bear order remains the leading authority on the Kjeragandr faith
      below the Saintess herself, but no longer has direct influence over
      secular matters.</p><p>Thus, while Parliament controls a vast majority of
      Kjerag’s activity, the official Head of State of Kjerag is the incumbent
      Saintess of Kjeragandr, the Karlan Saintess, who rules from the temple at
      the foot of Mount Karlan, atop which Kjeragandr herself is said to rest.
      As the Saintess, she has final say in any and all religious matters, and
      has a not-insignificant authority to wield in secular as well as holy
      matters; though how much official power she wields is unclear, none would
      gainsay her without reason.</p><p>Kjerag is, all in all, a deeply unusual
      land when compared to many places on Terra. Its relative freedom from
      Catastrophes and Oripathy has given its culture a chance to thrive rather
      than simply survive, and its inhospitable, difficult geography has
      protected it up to now from colonisation by foreign powers. In the south,
      the three Clans lead fledgling Kjerag onto the world stage through their
      own industrial revolution, and construction of a major railway hub to
      connect local nations and in doing so, attract investment into the nation.
      This brings threats of its own, however; increased connection to the
      outside world means greater pressure placed on the fledgling nation by the
      powers of the world, especially neighbouring Victoria. Whatever lies ahead
      for Kjerag, it will never be the same again.</p><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>As a place comparatively sparse on Catastrophes
      and, until recently, industry, Oripathy is somewhat uncommon in Kjerag.
      The incidence rate of cases has never been zero, and is experiencing an
      uptick as a result of advancing industrialisation, but Kjerag simply has
      not had reason or cause to develop the distrust (and sometimes outright
      hatred) some nations have for the Infected. To be an Infected in Kjerag is
      to be anyone else with a terminal illness; pitiable, but not the object of
      hatred.</p><p>Equally, however, its inexperience with this condition means
      that it has similarly not developed appropriate treatments, holistic or
      otherwise, for the condition.</p><h1>Kjeragian

      Feat (One Nation under Kjeragandr):</strong> Kjerag is an unusual land
      amongst the nations of Terra. It exists directly between two of Terra’s
      most powerful nations, and yet has never been subject to imperial
      ambitions. Until recent years, its impact on world affairs was
      non-existent. Its people dwell not in nomadic cities, but in stationary
      towns and villages, untouched by Catastrophes. This is thanks in no small
      part to the mountainous geography protecting them, but many in Kjerag
      would place the “blame” at the feet of their goddess, Kjeragandr. Dwelling
      atop the highest peak in the land, she is the patron of Kjerag; her
      blizzards are its shield, her love its warmth.</p><p>The people of Kjerag
      believe wholeheartedly in the protection of their Goddess. Real or not,
      their faith gives them strength where they should not.</p><ul><li><p>You
      are Proficient in the Lore Skill.</p></li><li><p>Once per Long Rest, when
      you would make a Saving Throw, you can choose to make a Lore Check
      instead. If the result of the Lore Check is equal to or greater than the
      Difficulty Class of the original effect, then that Saving Throw is
      successful.</p></li></ul><h3>Unique Background (Karlan Trade
      Operative):</h3><p>Karlan Trade is very new on the world stage, but has
      established itself as the primary link between the insular land of Kjerag
      and the outside world. Merchants clamouring to do business with an
      untapped market had to do so through Karlan, and thus they have rapidly
      developed a wealth of expertise.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You
      are Proficient in the Maintenance Kit or Tailoring Kit, and one other
      Tool/Vehicle of your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Discerning
      Eye):</strong> You might not directly be a Karlan trader, but you have
      seen and handled many items.</p><p>If given five minutes to examine an
      item, you can tell its provenance down to the person or organization
      likely responsible for its creation. If the item’s rarity is Very Rare or
      greater, or it is Unique, you might only be able to tell the nationality
      of the item. You also learn some of the recent history of the item;
      weapons and equipment bear marks of use, travel leaves marks on many
      items.</p><p>Additionally, you also have an inherent ability to tell when
      someone is trying to rip you off when buying or selling an item. You might
      not know how much the item is actually worth, but you will know if you’re
      being asked for too much or too little.</p>
