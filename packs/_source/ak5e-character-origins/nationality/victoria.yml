      <p>Victoria, one of Terra’s superpowers, is an imperial nation occupying
      the fertile lands in Terra’s heartland. Its territory encompasses much of
      what was Gaul, and all of what was Tara. It is hard to oversell Victoria’s
      influence, as the nation responsible for the beginning of the industrial
      revolution. Through the power of their leading industry and enterprising
      culture, Victoria gained fingers in almost every pie, including the
      establishment of two foreign colonies. Political crisis has led to its
      stagnation over the previous two decades, however, with their position as
      leader of industry actively challenged by Columbia and Kazimierz. To make
      matters worse, as of the turn of the 12th century, it is embroiled in a
      three way internal conflict between Taran seperatists, Victorian
      loyalists, and Kazdellian occupiers.</p><p>Victoria was originally founded
      by a large nomadic tribe led by a number of Draco by making a pact with a
      neighbouring tribe of Draco, who agreed to settle elsewhere; these lands
      would become known as Victoria and Tara, respectively. Later, to resist
      the Nightzmoran Khaganate, the Victorians forcefully annexed the Tarans,
      but allowed them to keep much of their autonomy, including their own king.
      In 737, Aslan exiles arrived en masse from Sargon, and were accepted and
      integrated into Victorian society. However, their natural charisma allowed
      them to gain strong popular support. In time, the Aslan houses began a
      coup against the Draco, quickly seizing power despite resistance from the
      Tarans.</p><p>The Victorian Draco and the Aslan formed a dual monarchy;
      the Taran Draco, while promised autonomy, never truly received it, with
      most of their affairs controlled by Victorian delegates. In the ninth
      century, the Aslan house made a further bid for power, dethroning the
      Victorian Draco to establish themselves as the de facto rulers of
      Victoria. Tara became the final stronghold for the Draco people, but after
      an exhausting conflict, the Taran King surrendered to the Victorian Aslan;
      an act that earned him an assassination from Taran loyalists who refused
      to accept the surrender.</p><p>Politically, Victoria has always been a
      Constitutional Monarchy, divided between the royal house and Parliament.
      The reigning monarch is the speaker of parliament, and is responsible for
      the nobility and military. Parliament is formed from two houses (Lords and
      Commons), which are both comprised of councillors formed into departments
      and committees responsible for the day-to-day running of the nation. The
      structure of Parliament is also mirrored in County Councils, meaning each
      county is theoretically capable of independent function. The structure of
      Victoria’s Parliament has been extremely influential on several nations;
      most notably Columbia and Kjerag.</p><p>In the past twenty years, however,
      the situation in Victoria has changed drastically. In 1072, the same year
      as the Draco Royal House was purged, Victoria was on the cusp of a
      financial crisis, as its vast coffers were depleted by foreign affairs; a
      giant breaking under its own weight. This was in no small part due to
      inequality in wealth between the nobles and the populace, and the current
      king threatened to impose higher taxes on the aristocracy. Feeling their
      power was under threat, members of the nobility manufactured a popular
      uprising against the King, claiming he had become an obstacle to Victoria.
      The King and much of his family were publicly hung in the garden of the
      Royal Palace.</p><p>This move caused great confusion within Victoria; many
      Victorians did not understand the reason why the uprising had even
      occurred, and many more had conflicting reasons. To compound matters, the
      eight grand dukes seized their opportunity and ruled without a king,
      forbidding any noble from entering the capital without permission. Thus
      Victoria, practically if not politically, fractured into eight different
      states, all technically sharing a capital that they were forbidden to
      enter.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Infected laws can vary between the individual
      counties of Victoria, as local nobles have a degree of autonomy in their
      laws, and what laws they enforce strongly. Generally speaking though,
      Infected are the lowest social class in Victoria, and are treated as such,
      especially by business owners and industrialists; in most areas they are
      forcibly segregated, and sheltering an Infected is a serious crime that
      can carry a prison sentence. To make matters worse, Victoria’s heavy
      industry has ensured that the Oripathy infection rate has continued to
      rise over time.</p><p>Before the Londinium Crisis, measures were beginning
      to be taken to end the social segregation of Victorian Infected and
      improve living conditions; these were partially implemented, but the
      Infected still face heavy difficulty accessing many
      services.</p></blockquote><p>For twenty years, the Grand Dukes have ruled
      their own fiefs, with the capital of Londinium under Parliament’s control.
      This has not been a positive experience for Victoria, causing
      technological and political stagnation. Taran Nationalism reached a new
      high, workers strikes and protests began to occur, and Gallic restoration
      movements sprang up in the former regions of Gaul. Amidst the crisis, the
      Duke of Cavendish invited the Military Commission of Kazdel to Londinium
      to discuss cooperation and restoring order. However, the Kazdellians
      betrayed the Duke, executing him and his supporters and seizing control of
      the capital, beginning the Londinium Crisis. Thus began a military crisis
      between the eight Dukes and the occupying Kazdellians, with the average
      Victorian caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Thus, Victoria is now a nation at
      war. Those that live in Londinium now live in an active war zone, under
      siege by their own countrymen. Those outside of Londinium often have
      martial law pressed upon them, regimenting many aspects of their lives.
      For those outside of the war zone, however; life goes on. The factories
      continue to work, the farms are more important than ever, and for many
      people, the war is a thing happening somewhere else. Victorian culture has
      influenced almost every nation on Terra, and in turn has been influenced
      by it; Victorian novels are read all over the world, depicting events and
      characters from other cultures. Cinematography and film originated in
      Victoria, and for those outside of the war-zone, is still a popular and
      thriving hobby. The villages are agrarian; not subsistence agriculture,
      but economic, utilising Victoria’s famous heavy machinery. The towns and
      cities are bustling hubs of industry and culture, and a general patriotic
      spirit. Victoria is wounded, but the sun has not set on the Empire just
      yet.</p><h1>Victorian Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong>
      Victorian + 2 Languages of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Acrobatics</p></li><li><p>Arts</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Persuasion</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Hegemonic Culture):</strong> Victoria has its fingers in pies all
      over the world; in any major population centre, there are likely to be
      Victorian expatriates, and you can track them down easily and request
      their aid.</p><p>As a Long Rest Activity while you are resting in any
      major settlement, you can attempt to contact fellow Victorians in that
      location. If there are any, you make contact at the end of that Long Rest.
      These folk recognise you as a fellow Victorian, and will shelter you and
      your allies, as well as providing whatever services they can. They will
      even hide you, should you require it, but they will not risk their lives
      for you on shared nationality alone.</p><h3>Unique Background (Military
      School Graduate):</h3><p>Victoria is, debatably, the foremost superpower
      on Terra. There are a number of factors for this, such as their
      geographical location, historical victories, and pervasive culture; but
      these alone wouldn’t be enough to maintain their dominance. What does so
      is the elite Victorian military, led by officers trained at their
      prodigious military academies. Such is the prestige of these academies
      that even foreign officers and nobles come to study at these illustrious
      institutions.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Officer):</strong> Your training

      possess.</p><p>Choose two of the Basic Tactics available to the Tactician
      Subclass; you may use these Tactics as if you were a Tactician. Your
      maximum Acumen to use these Tactics is 3, and you regain all expended
      Acumen when you complete a Long Rest. If you later choose the Tactician
      Branch, your maximum Acumen is instead increased by 3.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Taran Nationalist):</h3><p>Tara’s history is one of blood and
      betrayal. For centuries they have been beaten down, backstabbed, and
      misled. Even now, Tarans find themselves in the midst of a cataclysmic
      conflict in Victoria, and torn further still between the Red and Purple
      Dragons of Tara. Yet, Tara endures.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong>
      You are Proficient in the Tailoring Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of
      your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Great Flame of Tara):</strong>
      The Flame will never be extinguished.</p><p>Once per Long Rest, while you
