      <p>Rim Billiton, known in slang as Rim Billy, and officially as the Rim
      Mining Industry Association (RMIA), is unique amongst established Terran
      nations as being an anarchic state with no central government or head of
      state. It differs from more tribal locations like Sami, who are not
      considered a nation unto themselves, in that Rim Billiton is considered a
      political power in its own regard. Rim Billy is heavy industry manifested,
      relying on skilled families and their acquired knowledge to keep the
      engines of the world running.</p><p>The main denomination of Rim
      Billitonians are Cautus. Tribes of Cautus were the first settlers of the
      land, who made their homes underground or within caves to avoid the common
      Catastrophes that affect the region, often with an entire tribe living in
      one location. Over the centuries, several waves of people from various
      nations tried and failed to colonise the region, each being driven off or
      destroyed by the lethal environment. The survivors of these expeditions
      found themselves taken in by the local Cautus, and integrated into their
      large families. It is this idea; huge, non-blood related families working
      towards a single goal that is the very core of Billitonian culture
      today.</p><p>Rim Billiton is divided up into autonomous districts. These
      districts are grass-roots communities run by the families that live there;
      a district may be entirely owned by one family, though these families are
      not necessarily blood related, with huge numbers of biological families
      under that umbrella. As the industrial revolution has progressed, these
      families have begun to become subdivided into industries; guilders,
      miners, production teams, etc. They are still considered to be part of the
      same family, but generally speaking a Billitonian interacts more with
      their own subdivision than others. These areas are truly autonomous, and
      handle all of their own affairs unless it is an emergency, or related to
      national matters. There is a saying oft touted by Billitonians when asked
      about their unique system; “The bigger the problem, the more frequent a
      meeting is held, and the more time is
      wasted.”</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Thanks to its mining and industry, Rim Billiton
      has a vast Infected population. The treatment of the Infected varies from
      zone to zone, as there is no central government. While this means that
      there is no codified discrimination against them like in some nations,
      they are known to be treated as more disposable workers and given the
      riskier jobs, such as pitsinking. In other regions, they may be detained,
      especially if a Catastrophe has recently occurred. Some Rim Billy Infected
      will also place themselves into self exile to prevent any potential harm
      to their family.</p></blockquote><p>Their anarchic system has meant that
      they have struggled for their sovereignty for centuries, as the bigger
      powers in the world refuse to acknowledge their statehood. On several
      occasions, they have been forced to repel foreign incursions with tools
      and machinery against trained soldiers. Their knowledge of the land,
      combined with their innate unity, has meant a foreign power has never
      succeeded for very long. Thus, Billitonians have developed a reputation
      for being somewhat scrappy; contact sports are widely practised, including
      some inherited from Minos when they were banned there. In the modern age,
      Rim Billiton is responsible for so much of the world’s Originium mining
      that the superpowers have been forced to accept their sovereignty to
      ensure trade remains open.</p><p>Billiton itself is divided into two
      distinct categories; heavy industry, and the outback. Within and around
      the cities, everything in the nation is devoted to heavy industry. Almost
      everyone works in mining or an associated industry; construction,
      transportation, processing, manufacturing, etc. As a result, it is not
      uncommon to see children at work, even in the mines. Education rates in
      general are rather poor, with most people learning through experience
      rather than any formal education, though some families may opt to set up
      proper schooling for children, even if only part time. Everything else is
      arid shrubland and desert, which the locals call the Outback. Constant
      massive Catastrophes change the very geography, opening up new
      opportunities for mining the Targanglis Originium Prime vein, which is the
      densest vein on the continent. It is so large and so dense that it
      penetrates the surface, and represents 60% of all uncovered Originium
      deposits on Terra.</p><h1>Rim Billitonian
      Features</h1><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Victorian + 2 Languages of
      your Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Athletics</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li><li><p>Investigation</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Persuasion</p></li><li><p>Sleight
      of Hand</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality Feat (We All Lift
      Together):</strong> Rim Billiton is a place of heavy industry; almost
      everyone works in the mining industry, or in an industry that supports, or
      is supported by, mining. As such, almost every Rim Billy native learns to
      use the equipment associated with it, but also becomes indoctrinated in
      the culture that surrounds it. Billitonians tend not to care if you’re a
      Cautus or not, or even where you come from at all; as long as you can pull
      your weight on the job, and are up for some fun afterwards, you can be a
      complete stranger.</p><p>When you are performing a manual labour based
      task alongside other Creatures (such as moving cargo, mining, maintaining
      weaponry), you may use the Help Action as a Bonus Action, targeting all
      Creatures that are performing the same task as you. However, you can only
      grant Advantage on Skill Checks using Help in this way.</p><h3>Unique
      Background (Miner)</h3><p>A majority of Rim Billitonians work in the mines
      the nation is known for. It is far from easy work, cracking through
      dangerous, dark terrain in search of an even more dangerous mineral. That
      said, it does tend to build up a certain kind of strength and skill set;
      one that lends itself quite well to cathartic
      destruction.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Engineering Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Groundbreaker):</strong> Your
      undergrounder lifestyle has equipped you with the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have 10 feet of Blindsight. If you have, or
      gain, any other source of Blindsight, the range of that Blindsight is
      increased by 10 feet.</p></li><li><p>You deal double Damage to Objects and
      Structures with your Attacks.</p></li><li><p>You gain Proficiency with the
      Greataxe and Heavy Hammer, and can choose one to add to your Starting
      Equipment.</p></li></ul>
