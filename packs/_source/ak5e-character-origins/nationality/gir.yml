      <p>Up until around two centuries ago, Ægir was believed to be a myth; a
      thing of legend. It is not hard to see why. On the base of the ocean, off
      the southern coastline of Iberia, lie the cities of the Aegir; great
      biodomes built by harnessing the technology left behind by The First
      Civilisation. In the ninth century, refugees from Ægir fled to the shores
      of land, taking their technology with them. Iberia capitalised on the
      arrival of these “Islanders”, as they were known, and enjoyed a brief but
      prosperous period of co-operation, catapulting Iberia into the position of
      the foremost naval power on Terra behind Ægir herself. However, they took
      the boons of the Ægirians without heeding their warnings, leading to the
      great tsunami knows the Profound Silence. The Profound Silence all but
      destroyed Iberia, ending their golden age, and stranded the Ægir
      “Islanders” on dry land. Cut off from the mainland by the Seaborn, Ægir
      itself became legend once again; succeeded only by the works and people
      left behind.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Non-Aegir in
      Ægir</strong></p><p>Thanks to its geographical location and political
      isolation, non-Aegir citizens of Ægir are unheard of. To be so is not
      strictly impossible, but would require a very good
      explanation.</p></blockquote><p>Ægir has no head of state; each Ægir city
      is a city-state, ruled by a Consul and their Senate, which is itself
      comprised of two houses; the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of
      Technology. These Academies are made from the leading minds in their
      respective fields; if a proposal is agreed by both houses within a city
      and approved by the consul, that proposal is passed into law for all Ægir
      cities. Within each city, governance is carried out through debates in the
      Sophontheatrum; an amphitheatre open to any citizen to observe or engage
      with governance.</p><p>Individual life within Ægir is vastly different to
      anywhere else on Terra. Ægirians believe strongly in the concept of human
      centrism; despite their incredible technology, science and progress is a
      means, not an end. They strongly reject any idea of augmenting themselves
      with technology, believing that such a path would lead them to losing the
      humanity they value so strongly. In that same vein, Ægirian citizens are
      encouraged to pursue distinctly human pastimes; art, music, dance,
      sculpting, writing, just to name a few. Manual labour in Ægir is performed
      by machines and merely overseen by people, meaning that Ægirians have
      enough time to pursue these hobbies.</p><p>One of the most notable ways in
      which Ægir differs from many Terran civilisations is their separation from
      family; Ægirian children are rarely raised by their parents, instead
      raised in state-run public childcare. The role of a parent in Ægir society
      is more akin to that of a sponsor than a caregiver. Throughout their
      childhood, parents are allowed to keep contact with their children,
      assuming they do nothing to indicate that such a thing would be harmful.
      When a child comes of age, they are provided their future career by the
      city, to ensure a stable transition to adulthood.</p><p>In the modern age,
      Ægir has been forced to re-evaluate its isolationist stance. The threat of
      the Seaborn grows by the day, threatening to swamp Ægir if they stand
      alone. Recently, however, the lighthouses of Iberia, symbols of the
      co-operation between the nations and silent for almost a century, have
      begun to light again. The Iberians are fighting back, and thus Ægir
      prepares to cast off its shackles and return to the world stage, before
      there is nothing left to save.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Originium is all but completely absent in the
      ocean, and thus Oripathy is hardly ever observed amongst native Ægirians.
      Furthermore, all Ægirians are entitled to free healthcare provided by the
      state, and thus any who were to become Infected likely have good
      prospects. Finally, if it comes to this, Ægir practices voluntary
      euthanasia for the terminally ill.</p></blockquote><h3>Ægirian
      Features</h3><p><strong>Languages</strong>: Aegirian + 2 other Languages
      of your Choice.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> 3
      from:</p><ul><li><p>Medicine</p></li><li><p>Lore</p></li><li><p>Perception</p></li><li><p>Performance</p></li><li><p>Persuasion</p></li><li><p>Tech</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Sophontheatri):</strong> The social architecture of modern Ægir has
      been heavily influenced by the teachings of Martus the Sage. Though now a
      reviled figure, Ægir clings to his traditions of public debate to solve
      issues, and thus every Ægirian is intimately familiar with the art of
      debate.</p><p>When you fail a Persuasion Check to convince someone of your
      point of view, you may reroll that Check.</p><h3>Unique Background (Ægir
      Sage):</h3><p>The highly insular nation of Ægir has eclipsed the
      technology Level of surface dwellers in most respects. You are someone who
      is particular versed in Ægir’s scientific advancements; a beacon of
      enlightened thought and knowledge. To you, there is no distinction between
      study and reality.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in the Engineering Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Legacy of The
      Predecessors):</strong> Pedestrian technologies in Ægir are the stuff of
      science fiction novels to the land-bound, and thus Ægirians have no issues
      mastering their technology.</p><ul><li><p>You are Proficient in the
      Technology Skill.</p></li><li><p>Once per Short Rest, when you would make
      a Skill Check using your Intelligence Score, you can choose to make a
      Technology Check instead. If the result of the Technology Check is higher
      than the DC of the Skill Check, you succeed on that Skill
      Check.</p></li></ul>
