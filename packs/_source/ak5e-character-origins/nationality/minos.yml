      <p>To some, Minos might seem a simple, agrarian land that has fallen
      behind the times. While there may be some truth to that, there is no
      discounting their numerous achievements; much of Terra’s original
      political philosophy originates from Minos. There are Minoan sports that
      are played all around Terra, and while they do not produce much, Minoan
      goods are known to be of superlative quality; all from a nation only newly
      freed from the yoke of colonial oppression.</p><p>Minos’s founding myth
      tells that it was founded by a refugee leader named Ceresia, who searched
      for a place free from strife. Over time, the settlements grew and
      expanded, eventually becoming 10 city-states all loosely identifying with
      one another. It was during this time the Hero Cult had its beginnings; the
      oral retelling and performance of great deeds performed by Minoan
      exemplars. These 10 city-states were eventually unified under three
      banners, which are the modern day states of Minos; Athenus, Corinia, and
      Lachedamon. These states, while loosely aligned, could and would compete
      against each-other, but never to a point of conquest or eradication.
      Eventually, tired of the blood of Minoans being shed, they agreed to
      settle their difference with individual competitions between warriors. To
      begin, these were martial contests, but eventually would encompass other
      skills; this was the foundation for many Minoan sports.</p><p>Around 200
      years ago, the neighbouring nation of Sargon declared a war of annexation
      against Minos. Though the Sargonians paid a high, bloody price, they were
      successful in occupying Minos, and thus began the era of the Province of
      Minos. Under Sargonian rule, a heavily-Sargonized version of Minoan
      culture was pushed by their overlords, and any element of Minoan culture
      that could stir feelings of rebellion were outlawed; a majority of sports,
      many plays, and the Hero Cult itself. Rebellion against Sargonian rule was
      punished with slavery or death, and the Minoan culture itself was on the
      verge of dying out.</p><p>In 1038, however, political turmoil in Sargon
      gave the Minoans the opportunity to rise up, led by the now-deified Twelve
      Heroes of Hymnoi. The rebellion was successful in ousting the Sargonians
      and declaring independence, though the Sargonians still do not officially
      recognise it and periodically conduct raids upon the border. Since then,
      the Minoans have been reclaiming their culture, bringing the Hero Cult to
      the forefront of government and public conscience, and relearning old
      sports long outlawed. The Hymnoi Wisdom, named for the heroes, is a
      sporting event covering many disciplines that notable athletes from all
      over the world are sometimes invited to.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The
      Hero Cult</strong></p><p>The Hero Cult worships historical figures who
      have been influential enough to be enlisted in their pantheon, the Hall of
      Heroes. This worship comes in the form of trying to live their lives like
      the heroes did, but also in stage plays, songs, retellings, and artwork
      (especially statues).</p><p>Notably, to be a hero doesn’t necessarily mean
      to be a good person, as many of the heroes were deeply flawed. The
      contributions they make, and their efforts to overcome their flaws for the
      sake of others, is what makes a hero.</p></blockquote><p>Outside of the
      sporting events, life in Minos is mostly agricultural thanks to its very
      fertile land. There are several subsidiary industries such as brewing and
      textiles, but almost everything is connected to the land in some way. Each
      state rules itself, and thus there is no de facto head of state, but each
      state is a direct democracy overseen by the Priests of the Hero Cult. Each
      state has a Senate that guides day-to-day discussion, but any citizen is
      welcome to contribute and vote.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Infected
      Question</strong></p><p>Infected are treated comparatively well in Minos
      thanks to the benevolence espoused in the Hero Cult that a majority of
      Minoans follow. They suffer no persecution, and are able to receive
      healthcare; though Minoan Oripathy care is unfortunately limited, it is
      infinitely better than nothing. They also are not segregated, except in
      one notable example; Infected are not allowed to be clergymen/women of the
      Hero Cult. The reasons for this vary depending on who is asked, but the
      end result is the same. It is not to say, however, that there is no
      suspicion of Oripathy in Minos, just that most, but not all, are willing
      to look past it.</p></blockquote><h1>Minoan

      Handling</p></li><li><p>Wilderness</p></li></ul><p><strong>Nationality
      Feat (Resurrected Culture, Resurrected Spirit):</strong> Under Sargonian
      occupation, the venerable culture of Minos almost crumbled away to
      nothing, crushed to dust under the world-changing weight of imperialism.
      Now freed from the heel of their oppressors, Minoans have restored their
      culture with a fervor bending on fanaticism, and none will ever quash them
      again. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When making a Skill
      Check to do with playing a Sport, you are considered to be Proficient in
      that Skills. If you are already Proficient, you have Advantage on that
      Check.</p></li><li><p>When you make a Saving Throw to avoid or end an
      effect that would force you to take an Action or Actions against your
      will, you have Advantage on that Saving Throw.</p></li></ul><h3>Unique
      Background (Hero Cult Priest/ess)</h3><p>Those who lead the Hero Cult
      cannot afford to fall short- to fail themselves is to fail Minos. This is
      especially true if they can be seen.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong>
      You are Proficient in the Medical Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Aspirant):</strong> The very

      others bow, so that you may lift them up.</p><p>When you take the Help
      Action against a Creature with less current Hit Points than you, you
      additionally grant a 1d4 bonus to that Creature’s next Attack Roll or
      Skill Check they make within the next minute. This effect is not
      cumulative.</p><p>Starting from 7th Level, the Range at which you can
      perform the Help Action is increased to 30 feet, but the target must be
      able to hear you, and have less Hit Points than you.</p>
