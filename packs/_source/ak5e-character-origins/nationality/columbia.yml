      <p>The Columbian Union (typically shortened to Columbia) began as a
      Victorian Colony, established in the late 10th century due to the
      discovery of a huge Originium prime vein that was signficantly more stable
      that the similarly sized vein in Rim Billiton. The letter the explorers
      wrote home to the Victorian Parliament is mostly forgotten, but for one
      quote that would define Victorian politics even to the present day:</p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>“If a plot of a land can hold a boot, then
      it should belong to Victoria.”</em></p><p
      style="text-align:center"><em>Unnamed Explorer</em></p><p>As a result of a
      gigantic pioneer effort and mass immigration from Bolivar and Kazimierz,
      Columbia swiftly became the most prosperous colony in the region, and a
      power in its own right. Thus, when the years and oppressive policies from
      the colonial governor began to weigh heavy, the Columbians rose up in
      revolution against their Victorian overlords in the first half of the 11th
      century. Even with the Victorians distracted by Leithanien and Gaulish
      aggression, the revolutionaries were no match for the professional army of
      the Victorians, until two things changed; military aid from Gaul, and the
      emergence of Mark Max, a man who would become a legendary war hero. With
      his tactical acumen and the Gaulish support, Columbia won its
      independence, clearing the way for it to become to superpower it is
      today.</p><p>Ostensibly, Columbia is a federal republic under a national,
      democratic government. However, the presidential position has been
      occupied since Columbia’s independence by the hero Mark Max, who has been
      elected every single term, as there is no term limit. Externally, while
      Columbia has only ever been directly involved in two conflicts (those
      being their own Revolutionary War and the Bolivarian Civil War), they
      continue a soft “culture” war to this day. In Sargon, Columbian funding
      finds its way into the hands of pro-Columbian or anti-Sargon factions. In
      Sami, scientific research teams probing the ice-fields bring with them
      Columbian culture, which finds its way into the hands of the locals,
      alongside a little anti-Ursus sentiment.</p><p>For the city folk, Columbia
      is a sprawling metropolis with elements from cultures all over the world
      due to its colonial heritage. It is the primary hub for much of Terra’s
      media, such as the film industry, and when combined with government
      backing, Columbian art and sports has gotten its hooks into almost all
      nations on Terra. Columbia proclaims itself a land of equity where all,
      including Sarkaz and Infected, are given equal opportunity.</p><p>On the
      surface, this is true; secretly, however, these folk are enticed to the
      rough frontier rather than the cities, leading the difficult process of
      expansion where crime is rampant, medical care (especially for Infected)
      is scarce, and Catastrophes are common.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The
      Infected Question</strong></p><p>Columbia’s origins as a mining colony and
      its modern status as an industrial powerhouse mean that Oripathy is a
      present threat. Those with Oripathy are not directly discriminated
      against, but taken advantage of in a more insidious way; Infected must
      regularly pay for insurance, ostensibly to pay for any care they require.
      In practice however, this is a payment to be allowed to keep their jobs,
      and the premiums for this insurance is often far in excess of what most
      can comfortably afford. Those who are forced to default on their debts as
      a result of these insurance payments are given the choice of moving into
      slum-like quarantine zones, or becoming pioneers of the frontier to
      continue the great westward push.</p></blockquote><h1>Columbian
