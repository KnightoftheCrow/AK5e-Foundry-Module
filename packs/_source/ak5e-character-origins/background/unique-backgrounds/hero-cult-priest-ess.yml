  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Those who lead the Hero Cult cannot afford to fall short- to fail
      themselves is to fail Minos. This is especially true if they can be
      seen.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Medical Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Aspirant):</strong> The very
      essence of a Hero is to succeed where others fail, especially on behalf of
      others, or to overcome your own weakness. You must stand tall, even when
      others bow, so that you may lift them up.</p><p>When you take the Help
      Action against a Creature with less current Hit Points than you, you
      additionally grant a 1d4 bonus to that Creature’s next Attack Roll or
      Skill Check they make within the next minute. This effect is not
      cumulative.</p><p>Starting from 7th Level, the Range at which you can
      perform the Help Action is increased to 30 feet, but the target must be
      able to hear you, and have less Hit Points than you.</p>
