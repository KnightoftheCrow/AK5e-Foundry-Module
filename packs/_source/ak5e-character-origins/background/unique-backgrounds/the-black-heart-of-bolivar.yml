      <p>Dossoles is a place of two sides; the glitz and glamour of its tourist
      industry, and the smog and corruption of its underground and industry. For
      the people that live there, having contact with both halves is inevitable.
      It is a part of life, and you must learn to accept
      it.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Mechanism Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Unsuspected):</strong> Unless they
      have evidence, or the other possible explanations are too fantastical,
      your nonchalance towards criminal activity makes people unwilling to
      suspect you before other options. Furthermore, you have Advantage on any
      Charisma based Skill Check to convince people to overlook suspicious
      activity.</p>
