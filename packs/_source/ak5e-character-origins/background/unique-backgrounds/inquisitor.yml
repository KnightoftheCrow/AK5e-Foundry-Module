    value: >-
      <p>The Iberian Inquistion is an oppressive, theocratic regime that has the
      Iberian people locked tight within its grip of fear. This is truth. They
      are also the only reason the Seaborn have not overrun those who remain;
      this too is truth.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in the Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Arms of Justice):</strong> As an
      Inquisitor, you are skilled with the Inquisition’s
      tools.</p><ul><li><p>You are Proficient with the Sword, and gain one as
      Starting Equipment.</p><ul><li><p>You gain one of the Lanterns of the
      Iberian Inquisition as Starting Equipment. The Lantern has the same
      Profile as an Arts Wand, but does not have the Casting Unit Property.
      While you are wielding the Lantern:</p></li><li><p>Allied Creatures within
      10 feet of you add your Proficiency Bonus to Wisdom Saving Throws they
      make; this effect is not cumulative.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Aberration
      (Seaborn) Creatures have Disadvantage on Attack Rolls against
      you.</p></li></ul>
