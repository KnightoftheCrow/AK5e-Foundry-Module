  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The highly insular nation of Ægir has eclipsed the technology Level of
      surface dwellers in most respects. You are someone who is particular
      versed in Ægir’s scientific advancements; a beacon of enlightened thought
      and knowledge. To you, there is no distinction between study and
      reality.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Engineering Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Legacy of The
      Predecessors):</strong> Pedestrian technologies in Ægir are the stuff of
      science fiction novels to the land-bound, and thus Ægirians have no issues
      mastering their technology.</p><ul><li><p>You are Proficient in the
      Technology Skill.</p></li><li><p>Once per Short Rest, when you would make
      a Skill Check using your Intelligence Score, you can choose to make a
      Technology Check instead. If the result of the Technology Check is higher
      than the DC of the Skill Check, you succeed on that Skill
      Check.</p></li></ul>
