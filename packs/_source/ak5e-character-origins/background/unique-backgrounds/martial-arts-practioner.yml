  description:
    value: >-
      <p>There are a great number of schools of Martial Arts in Yan; some are
      commercialised, teaching self defence to the masses and hosting publicised
      tournaments, while others are traditional, holding to the idea that
      Martial Arts are a tool for preserving peace, first and
      foremost.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Art Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Wuxia):</strong> Whichever
      philosophy you subscribe to, you have learned a thing or two.</p><p>After
      you hit a Creature within 5 feet of you with an Attack, you may attempt
      the Shove Action against that Creature as a Bonus Action. You may use this
      Feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all
      uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
