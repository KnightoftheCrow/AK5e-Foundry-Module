      <p>Given their importance to the Samifjod, Snowpriests do not tend to
      wander much. On occasion, however, a vision or a premonition will be so
      potent as to drive them to leave their post for a greater
      cause.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Pharmacology Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Amma’s Guidance):</strong> As a
      Long Rest Activity, you may divine messages from nature. You may ask a
      question about an action you intend to perform in the next 24 hours (such
      as “crossing the canyon”, “attacking that convoy”, etc); the DM chooses an
      omen for you regarding that action from the following
      table:</p><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Omen</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>For
      results that are likely to
      be</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Weal</p></td><td><p>Good</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Woe</p></td><td><p>Bad</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weal
      and Woe</p></td><td><p>Good and
      Bad</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Indifference</p></td><td><p>Neither Good nor
      Bad</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This should be truthful to the best of
      the DM’s knowledge at the time. If there is a trap in place, then a Woe
      result might be appropriate. If there is no current DM plans for anything
      to go awry, a Weal result might be appropriate. However, this does not
      account for changes in circumstance; something may happen between then and
      now that changes this result; it is merely a prediction, not an accurate
      telling of the future.</p>
