  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The violent nature of the Lupi is a potent and heady mix when combined
      with the activities of a mafioso, and you know best how to exert your
      strength to get what you want.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You
      are Proficient in the Mechanism Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Pistole e Ordine):</strong>
      “Pistole e Ordine,” the “Guns and Order”; through violence will there be
      peace. Family culture and Faith teaches that violence is always an
      available solution for problems, so long as you apply enough of
      it.</p><ul><li><p>Your Melee Attacks against Creatures with a Speed of 0
      (such as tied up Creatures) deal additional Damage equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus.</p></li><li><p>When you make an Intimidation Check, you
      may add a bonus to that Check equal to the last Damage you dealt to them
      with a Melee Attack.</p></li></ul>
