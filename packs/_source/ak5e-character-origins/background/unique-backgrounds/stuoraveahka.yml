  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You have dwelled Sami’s northern wastes, and battled the demons that
      pour from the north; an endless tide of illusion, misdirection, and death.
      It has hardened your mind and spirit against the predations of the
      Collapsals.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Woodwork Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Demon Hunter):</strong> While you
      are affected by illusion-esque effects and Arts, such as Phantasmal
      Killer, you can end that effect as an Action. Additionally, even if you
      fail a Skill Check to detect an illusion, you will know that something is
      wrong, even if you cannot identify what. Finally, you have Advantage on
      Saving Throws against Aberrations.</p>
