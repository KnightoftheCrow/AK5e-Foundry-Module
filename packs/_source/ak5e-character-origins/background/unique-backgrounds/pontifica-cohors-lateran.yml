    value: >-
      <p>The Cohors Lateran are one of two military arms of Laterano, and are
      primarily responsible for defending Laterano and its citizens, and
      securing Lateran interests. The other side is the Apostolic Knights, who
      occupy a more offensive-orientated
      niche.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Legion of Heaven):</strong> If
      another Creature you can see is hit by an Attack, you can expend your
      Reaction to choose a weapon you are wielding. If the attacked Creature is
      within the Reach or the Normal Range for that weapon, you can make an
      Attack Roll using it; if the result of that Attack Roll is equal to or
      greater than the result of triggering Attack, the triggering Attack misses
      the attacked Creature.</p><p>Once you have used this Feature, you must
      complete a Short or Long Rest before you can do so again.</p>
