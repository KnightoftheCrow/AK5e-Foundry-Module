  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Pathfinders are a heretical organisation that seeks to end the
      isolationism of Laterano and bring aid to the unfortunate of the world,
      rather than promising heaven. They accept all faithful, including Sarkaz.
      They find their own path, and refuse to follow the path laid out for
      them.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in two
      Tools/Vehicles of your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Find the
      Path):</strong> You lose all Skill Proficiencies from your Species and
      Nationality, and cannot gain any Skill Proficiencies. Instead, you have
      Proficiency Points; you start off with 3 at Level 1, and gain 1 every
      Level thereafter. You invest these points into your Skills when you get
      them; each one you invest gives you a +1 Bonus to Skill Checks and your
      Passive Score using that Skill. The maximum points you can have invested
      into a Skill is equal to your Character Level +3.</p><p>If you would gain
      a Skill Proficiency from a different source, such as from your Class, you
      instead gain 1 Proficiency Point; if you would gain Expertise in a Skill,
      you instead gain 3 Proficiency Points.</p><p>You are considered Proficient
      in any Skill you have Proficiency Points invested in. If the amount of
      points you have invested in a Skill is greater than your Proficiency
      Bonus, you are considered to have Expertise in that Skill.</p>
