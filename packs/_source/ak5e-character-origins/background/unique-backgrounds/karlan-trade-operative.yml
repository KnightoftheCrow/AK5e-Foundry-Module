    value: >-
      <p>Karlan Trade is very new on the world stage, but has established itself
      as the primary link between the insular land of Kjerag and the outside
      world. Merchants clamouring to do business with an untapped market had to
      do so through Karlan, and thus they have rapidly developed a wealth of
      expertise.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit or Tailoring Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Discerning Eye):</strong> You might
      not directly be a Karlan trader, but you have seen and handled many
      items.</p><p>If given five minutes to examine an item, you can tell its
      provenance down to the person or organization likely responsible for its
      creation. If the item’s rarity is Very Rare or greater, or it is Unique,
      you might only be able to tell the nationality of the item. You also learn
      some of the recent history of the item; weapons and equipment bear marks
      of use, travel leaves marks on many items.</p><p>Additionally, you also
      have an inherent ability to tell when someone is trying to rip you off
      when buying or selling an item. You might not know how much the item is
      actually worth, but you will know if you’re being asked for too much or
      too little.</p>
