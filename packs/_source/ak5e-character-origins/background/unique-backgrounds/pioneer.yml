      <p>You are used to living in rough terrain. You are good with both people,
      plants, animals, understanding their behaviour and needs in a practical
      sense, though life on the Pioneer is far from kind and often requires use
      of force.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Frontier Knowledge):</strong> When
      you complete a Long Rest, you can determine what types of animals and
      plants are available in the biome in which you rested, and know where you
      might look to find them. After doing so, until you next finish a Long
      Rest:</p><ul><li><p>You have Advantage on Animal Handling and Wilderness
      Checks regarding the Flora and Fauna in that
      area.</p></li><li><p>Furthermore, once per Turn, when you would deal
      Damage to a Creature of the Beast or Plant type, you can deal additional
      Damage to them equal to your Proficiency Bonus.</p></li></ul>
