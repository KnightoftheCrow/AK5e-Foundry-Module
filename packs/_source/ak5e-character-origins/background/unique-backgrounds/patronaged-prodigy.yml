  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The upper class of Leithanien are often willing to sponsor upcoming
      talent, to free them from drudgery so that they may focus on their art,
      music, or whatever else they are good at. Of course, this is rarely done
      for altruistic purposes; most just want a hand in the development of these
      talents, to mould them and thus secure their own claim to
      fame.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in either
      the Art Kit, an Instrument, or the Makeover Kit. In addition, you are
      Proficient in one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Patronage):</strong> Your art,
      whatever it may be, is impressive enough to have attracted attention. You
      have a Patron to support you. They will bankroll you, provide you with
      modest accommodation, spread your works and possibly gain you fame.
      However, if you abuse their patronage or do not produce adequate work, you
      will lose that patronage.</p>
