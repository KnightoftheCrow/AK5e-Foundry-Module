  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Victoria is, debatably, the foremost superpower on Terra. There are a
      number of factors for this, such as their geographical location,
      historical victories, and pervasive culture; but these alone wouldn’t be
      enough to maintain their dominance. What does so is the elite Victorian
      military, led by officers trained at their prodigious military academies.
      Such is the prestige of these academies that even foreign officers and
      nobles come to study at these illustrious
      institutions.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Officer):</strong> Your training
      gives you a tactical flexibility that most others simply do not
      possess.</p><p>Choose two of the Basic Tactics available to the Tactician
      Subclass; you may use these Tactics as if you were a Tactician. Your
      maximum Acumen to use these Tactics is 3, and you regain all expended
      Acumen when you complete a Long Rest. If you later choose the Tactician
      Branch, your maximum Acumen is instead increased by 3.</p>
