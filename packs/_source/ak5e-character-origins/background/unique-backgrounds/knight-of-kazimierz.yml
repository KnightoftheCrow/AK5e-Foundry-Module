    value: >-
      <p>You are, or were, part of a Knightly organisation. Decide with your GM
      when you select this background some more details about it, and your
      relationship with them; do you belong to an old family, or a knightclub?
      Are they commercial knights, or campaign knights? What is their stance on
      the Infected? Are you still on good terms with
      them?</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Gallant Demeanour):</strong>
      Regardless of your relationship with them, your time with them has changed
      your demeanour, making you appear reliable and trustworthy. When you
      promise someone that you will do something, you can make them a vow; if
      you do, you gain a +10 bonus to Charisma based Checks against that person,
      as long as it relates to the vow you made, until you either complete your
      vow or break it. You can only have one active vow at a time. If you break
      your vow, it marks your demeanour as much as your honour; the bonus you
      gain from this Feature is permanently reduced by 5, to a minimum of
      0.</p><p>Furthermore, you are Proficient with the Spear and Polearm, and
      you may choose one of these to gain as Starting Equipment.</p>
