  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Samurai began their history as noble retainers, and in the modern
      age are simply a professional military. They protect Higashi from any and
      all who might threaten her.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in the Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Bushido Spirit):</strong>
      Higashinese Samurai have battled man and monster for a thousand years,
      proud and potent warriors. It is not easy to put down these
      aspersions.</p><p>You have a special resource called Pride; your maximum
      amount of Pride is two, and you regain all expended Pride when you
      complete a Long Rest. You may spend Pride during your Turn (no Action
      required) to do one of the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Reroll a failed
      Attack Roll; you must use the new result.</p></li><li><p>Move half of your
      Speed directly towards a hostile Creature.</p></li><li><p>Grant yourself
      Advantage on a Saving Throw to resist or end the Frightened
      Condition.</p></li></ul><p>However, if you are defeated, your Pride is
      permanently damaged. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your maximum
      number of Pride is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. When your maximum
      number of Pride is reduced, it cannot be reduced again until you roll
      Initiative.</p><p>You may regain a lost Pride by landing the killing blow
      on a Leader Creature, or by performing a similarly impressive combat feat
      based on GM discretion.</p>
