    value: >-
      <p>The Sarkaz are familiar as people on the outskirts of society, even in
      their homeland. Your perspective as an outsider allows you to see things
      others might miss.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are
      Proficient in the Cooking Kit or Brewing Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (The Exiled):</strong> If
      you spend a day within a population centre listening in, you can quickly
      pick up on things like balance of power, pressing issues, news, and who is
      important, even if these things aren’t directly stated or talked about.
      Many people will prefer not to acknowledge you, and thus might talk about
      things as if you weren’t there. However, people will tend not to trust you
      on face value, and will especially not react kindly to you snooping
      about.</p><p>Additionally, you reduce the penalty to your Passive
      Perception for travelling at a Fast Pace or in a Vehicle by 5 for yourself
      only (EG. a -5 becomes 0, a -10 becomes -5).</p>
