  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The tribes-people of Acahualla, specifically its Archosaurian
      inhabitants, are known for their scrappy nature. Violence to them is
      barely a hostile action most of the time; it’s just a way to settle
      disputes like any other contest, nothing to get overly upset over.
      Besides, its fun to brawl and then drink after. Suffice to say, even if
      you’re not an Archosaurian, you’re used to
      it.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Brewing Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Never Counted Out):</strong> Your
      lust for battle and contest fuels you through injury.</p><p>Whenever a
      combat you were involved in ends, you recover missing Hit Points equal to
      your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution Modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
