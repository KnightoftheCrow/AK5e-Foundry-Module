  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A majority of Rim Billitonians work in the mines the nation is known
      for. It is far from easy work, cracking through dangerous, dark terrain in
      search of an even more dangerous mineral. That said, it does tend to build
      up a certain kind of strength and skill set; one that lends itself quite
      well to cathartic destruction.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You
      are Proficient in the Engineering Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Groundbreaker):</strong> Your
      undergrounder lifestyle has equipped you with the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have 10 feet of Blindsight. If you have, or
      gain, any other source of Blindsight, the range of that Blindsight is
      increased by 10 feet.</p></li><li><p>You deal double Damage to Objects and
      Structures with your Attacks.</p></li><li><p>You gain Proficiency with the
      Greataxe and Heavy Hammer, and can choose one to add to your Starting
      Equipment.</p></li></ul>
