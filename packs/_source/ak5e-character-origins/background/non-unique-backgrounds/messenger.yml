    value: >-
      <p>Since the dawn of Terran civilisation, the role of a messenger has been
      an invaluable but oft unappreciated one; not just for the delivering of
      typical messages, but also for relaying information about oncoming
      Catastrophes. Even into the modern age, where the establishment of
      communication relays reduces the need for physical messengers, Catastrophe
      messengers still must maintain the equipment, and in areas uncovered by
      the relays, deliver these lifesaving messages
      personally.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in
      the Messenger Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Deliverance):</strong> Whether you
      maintain the communication stations, or deliver the messages manually, in
      the Catastrophe ridden world of Terra, your services are essential. It is
      you who braves the storm, all to ensure the people along the path might
      have the chance to survive.</p><ul><li><p>It only costs you 5 feet of
      movement for you to get up from a Prone position.</p></li><li><p>You have
      Advantage on any Skill Check or Saving Throw to navigate and survive
      against the environment, such as to avoid falling rocks, scramble up a
      collapsing cliff, or resist hostile weather.</p></li></ul>
