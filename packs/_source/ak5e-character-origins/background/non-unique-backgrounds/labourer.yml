      Land Vehicles, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Breaking Common Ground):</strong>
      Other labourers and working class folks recognise you as one of their own,
      a person of good stock and hard work.</p><ul><li><p>You know how to endear
      yourself to other working class folks; you can find lodgings and
      sustenance amongst such people with ease. However, they will not endanger
      themselves for you or go against their morals based on shared background
      alone.</p></li><li><p>Your Hit Point maximum increases by an amount equal
      to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter, your Hit Point
      maximum increases by an additional Hit Point.</p></li></ul>
