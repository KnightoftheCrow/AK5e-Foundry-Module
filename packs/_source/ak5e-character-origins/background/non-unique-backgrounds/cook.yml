      <p>An army marches on its stomach, or so the saying goes. You are an
      expert in this department, and even a simple dish whipped up by you can
      invigorate the weariest soul.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You
      are Proficient in the Cooking Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Chef’s Touch):</strong> The food
      you can prepare can sate even the most voracious. Furthermore, your
      experience with a variety of ingredients gives you a good sense for what
      is and isn’t safe to eat.</p><ul><li><p>When you use a Cooking Kit to
      prepare a Meal, the amount of Temporary Hit Points you grant is
      doubled.</p></li><li><p>You can identify whether food is safe or dangerous
      to eat by succeeding on a DC15 Perception Check. If you have a Cooking Kit
      and are Proficient in it, you have Advantage on this Check. At GM
      Discretion, this DC may be raised or lowered based on what has been used
      to make the food dangerous; if it even is.</p></li></ul>
