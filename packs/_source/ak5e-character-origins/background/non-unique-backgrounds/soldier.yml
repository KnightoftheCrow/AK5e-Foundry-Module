      <p>Terra is a war-torn land at the best of times. Even its periods of
      peace feel like mere armistice, with another threat always on the horizon.
      You are one of the people who has sworn to do something about it, whether
      you volunteered or were “recruited”.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong>
      You are Proficient in the Maintenance Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of
      your choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Military Training):</strong>
      Wherever you served, you learn to trust the weapon in your hand as much as
      you trust the comrade at your side. The lessons you learned, for better or
      worse, will never leave you. You gain Proficiency in one Weapon of your
      choice from one of the following categories that does not have the Firearm
      Property:</p><ul><li><p>Light Melee</p></li><li><p>Heavy
      Melee</p></li><li><p>Light Ranged</p></li><li><p>Heavy
      Ranged</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, the Weapon you choose is added to your
