    value: >-
      <p>Plain and simple, your life’s calling is to preserve the lives of
      others, sometimes at the cost of your own safety. In the dangerous world
      of Terra, a person willing to stick their own neck out for nothing but
      morals is a noble soul indeed.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You
      are Proficient in the Medical Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Lifesaver):</strong> Whatever your
      medical background, from self-taught Sargonians to university educated
      Siracusans, your main goal is to preserve and save
      life.</p><ul><li><p>When you use a Healer’s Kit to restore Hit Points to a
      Creature, the amount restored is doubled.</p></li><li><p>Whenever you roll
      dice to determine the amount of Hit Points you restore to another
      Creature, you can reroll any result of 1 on those dice, but must use the
      new result.</p></li></ul>
