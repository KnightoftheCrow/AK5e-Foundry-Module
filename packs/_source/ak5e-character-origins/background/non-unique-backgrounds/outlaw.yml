  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Living in the underbelly, or on the fringes, of civilisation, you make
      your living through… unconventional means. How did you end up here, and if
      you intend to change your ways; why
      now?</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in the
      Mechanism Kit, and one other Tool/Vehicle of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Honour Among Thieves):</strong>
      Whatever your profession in the criminal underworld, you have learned how
      the other side lives, and how best to fit in with that underbelly. The
      nature of being outside the law means you must rely on unconventional
      means and connections.</p><ul><li><p>You know the behaviours and language
      that allow you to fit in with most types of people outside the law; more
      specialist groups may be beyond you, but “ordinary” outlaws are usually
      willing to accept you, if not trust you.</p></li><li><p>As a Long Rest
      Activity while in a major settlement, you can establish communication with
      a contact you know, or perhaps have heard of, to do you a favour. Perhaps
      they are an armoursmith willing to give you a discount, or a doctor
      willing to treat Infected. Regardless, you can usually find these people,
      but they will usually want something in return for their
      services.</p></li></ul>
