      <p>Nobility can be found in a majority of Terran lands. Even in lands
      without traditional nobility, there are always those who hold more wealth
      or status than those around them. You are one such person; did you earn
      your status, or inherit it? How do you view the people not as fortunate as
      you?</p><p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> You are Proficient in one
      Tool/Vehicle of your choice, and learn a Language of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Background Feat (Privilege):</strong> You know best
      how to carry yourself and exert your influence.</p><ul><li><p>If you make
      a reasonable request to someone who recognises your status, they will do
      their best to comply with your wishes without needing to be
      convinced.</p></li><li><p>When you make a Charisma-based Skill Check to
      make someone perform an action, you do so at Advantage providing they
      recognise you as being superior to them.</p></li></ul>
