      <p>You might not directly be a Karlan trader, but you have seen and
      handled many items.</p><p>If given five minutes to examine an item, you
      can tell its provenance down to the person or organization likely
      responsible for its creation. If the item’s rarity is Very Rare or
      greater, or it is Unique, you might only be able to tell the nationality
      of the item. You also learn some of the recent history of the item;
      weapons and equipment bear marks of use, travel leaves marks on many
      items.</p><p>Additionally, you also have an inherent ability to tell when
      someone is trying to rip you off when buying or selling an item. You might
      not know how much the item is actually worth, but you will know if you’re
      being asked for too much or too little.</p><p><strong>No automation
      required.</strong></p>
