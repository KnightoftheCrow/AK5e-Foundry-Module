      <p>All that matters is that you live to see the sun shine again; if you
      don’t, what was it all worth?</p><p>During a Long Rest, you can find
      suitable places to rest out of the weather, and scavenge enough food to
      (badly) feed yourself and a number of other Creatures equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus. Additionally, you can rely on the comradeship of others
      who are, or have been, in the same position; other downtrodden people will
      treat you as a friend unless you do something to anger or upset
      them.</p><p><strong>Automation not needed.</strong></p>
