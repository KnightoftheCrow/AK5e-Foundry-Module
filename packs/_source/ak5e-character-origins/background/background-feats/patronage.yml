      <p>Your art, whatever it may be, is impressive enough to have attracted
      attention. You have a Patron to support you. They will bankroll you,
      provide you with modest accommodation, spread your works and possibly gain
      you fame. However, if you abuse their patronage or do not produce adequate
      work, you will lose that patronage.</p><p><strong>Automation not
