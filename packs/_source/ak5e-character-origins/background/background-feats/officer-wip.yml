      <p>Your training gives you a tactical flexibility that most others simply
      do not possess.</p><p>Choose two of the Basic Tactics available to the
      Tactician Subclass; you may use these Tactics as if you were a Tactician.
      Your maximum Acumen to use these Tactics is 3, and you regain all expended
      Acumen when you complete a Long Rest. If you later choose the Tactician
      Branch, your maximum Acumen is instead increased by 3.</p>
