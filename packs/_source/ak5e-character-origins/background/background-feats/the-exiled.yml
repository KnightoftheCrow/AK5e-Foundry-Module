    value: >-
      <p>If you spend a day within a population centre listening in, you can
      quickly pick up on things like balance of power, pressing issues, news,
      and who is important, even if these things aren’t directly stated or
      talked about. Many people will prefer not to acknowledge you, and thus
      might talk about things as if you weren’t there. However, people will tend
      not to trust you on face value, and will especially not react kindly to
      you snooping about.</p><p>Additionally, you reduce the penalty to your
      Passive Perception for travelling at a Fast Pace or in a Vehicle by 5 for
      yourself only (EG. a -5 becomes 0, a -10 becomes
      -5).</p><p><strong>Automation not required.</strong></p>
