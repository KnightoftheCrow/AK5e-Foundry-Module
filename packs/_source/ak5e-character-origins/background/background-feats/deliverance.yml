      along the path might have the chance to survive.</p><ul><li><p>It only
      costs you 5 feet of movement for you to get up from a Prone
      position.</p></li><li><p>You have Advantage on any Skill Check or Saving
      Throw to navigate and survive against the environment, such as to avoid
      falling rocks, scramble up a collapsing cliff, or resist hostile
      weather.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Automation not required.</strong></p>
