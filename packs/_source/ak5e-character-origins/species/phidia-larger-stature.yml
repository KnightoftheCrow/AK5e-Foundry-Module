      <p>Oft conflated with their Archosaurian cousins, the Phidia could hardly
      differ more mentally from their brutish distant relatives, despite surface
      level similiarity. Both possess pointed ears, scaled skin, and long,
      scaled tails; there the comparison ends. Where Archosaurians are stocky
      and powerful, Phidia are tall and lithe, even gangly. Where Archosaurians
      are tough and resilient, Phidia are comparitively frail, though the
      emphasis falls on “comparitively”. Even their tails are different if one
      cares to learn; Archosaurian tails are built for striking and whipping,
      while Phidian tails have much greater flexibility and can be used to pick
      up and even hold objects with some conditioning.</p><p>Unfortunately,
      false comparisons to Archosauria are not the only stereotypes and
      misunderstandings to which the Phidia are subject. They are often prone to
      obsessive behaviour when chasing an objective; when a Phidia has set their
      mind to something, they will often work away at that goal to the exclusion
      of most else, giving them an air of eccentricity that sets many at edge.
      Furthermore, their incredibly adept senses allow them to seemingly “know”
      things they should not, by picking up on scents and sounds beyond the
      range of many others; when the whole package is considered, many have a
      distrustful view of Phidia as sly and cold-hearted.</p><p>Phidia can be
      found all over Terra, living around the outskirts of civilization, or with
      a scant tribe of those that accept them and their eccentricities. Unlike
      many Terran species, Phidia are distinctly solitary, and it is a rare
      Phidia indeed that can be found in a highly populated area.</p><h1>Phidia
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Phidians are typically between 5
      and a half and 6 and a half feet in height, trending towards the top half
      of that bracket, and weighing around 160 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Phidia reach adulthood
      around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Intelligence
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Variant: Larger Stature</strong></p><p>When
      you choose this species, you can choose for your size to be Large. If you
      do, your base Walking Speed increases by 5ft, but you cannot wear
      equipment that isn’t made for someone of your
      size.</p></blockquote><h1>Phidia Features</h1><p>As a Phidia, you gain the
      following Features:</p><h3>Agendum</h3><p>Phidia are notoriously
      single-minded. That is not to say that they are bull-headed or stubborn
      (though some may accuse them of this), but that when they have set
      themselves on a goal, little short of death will sway them from it. Theirs
      is not the nigh-fanatical obsession of the Zalak, but an unrelenting,
      resolute march.</p><p>When you choose this Species, you must also work
      with your DM to choose an Agenda.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What’s an
      Agenda?</strong></p><p>An Agenda is a long-term goal representing the
      Phidian tendency for obsession; an Agenda can be something with a concrete
      end, such as “I want to kill Regent Theresis” or something more abstract,
      such as “My passion is toxicology, and I want to pursue it”. You should
      consider why this is important enough to your character for them to obsess
      over it.</p></blockquote><p>When you perform a Skill Check directly
      related to pursuing your Agenda, you may do so with Advantage. The DM has
      discretion on whether a Skill Check relates to pursuing your Agenda. When
      you complete a major task towards following your Agenda (DM discretion),
      you gain a special Inspiration that only expires when you succeed on a d20
      roll as a result of using it.</p><p>If you complete your Agenda, work with
      your DM to create another one.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:
      Following your Agenda</strong></p><p>If your Agenda was “I want to kill
      Regent Theresis”, then using Intimidation to coerce information out of a
      Sarkaz soldier with no direct connection to the Regent would not count as
      pursuing your Agenda. However, doing the same to an officer who knows
      where you might find the Regent would count.</p><p>Completing a major task
      for this Agenda may involve taking down a officer close to the Regent, or
      interfering with his plans in a major
      way.</p></blockquote><h3>Constrictor</h3><p>The thin tail of a Phidia is
      not built for striking in the way of their Archosaurian cousins. The lean
      muscle of a Phidian tail is bent to the task of grasping and constricting,
      almost approximating a prehensile limb. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Prehensile.</strong> During each of your Turns,
      you can interact with two objects without having to use your Action, as
      opposed to one.</p><p><strong>Python Strike.</strong> When you take the
      Grapple Action, you can do so using your tail and thus not requiring a
      free hand. When you make a Athletics Check to initiate a Grapple in this
      way, or prevent a Creature grappled by your tail from escaping, you may
      use your Dexterity Bonus instead of Strength.</p><h3>Ophidian
      Sonar</h3><p>Like the Ophidians they represent, Phidia have an extremely
      developed sensory system; it is unfair to say that they simply have a good
      sense of hearing or smell, for the both are so inherently intwined in a
      Phidia as to make no difference. When they are paying close attention to
      their surroundings, you may see a Phidia with their mouth slightly ajar,
      to better allow for smells and vibrations to permeate through the
      biological sonar they possess. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Sonar Pulse.</strong> As an Action, you can focus
      completely on your hearing and smell at the exclusion of all else. If you
      do so, you learn how many Creatures are within 100 feet of you; you learn
      nothing of their intentions, affiliations or directions, but if they are
      covered by a particularly strong scent (such as blood), you can detect
      it.</p><p>However, when you use this Feature, you are considered to be
      Blind until the beginning of your next
      Turn.</p><p><strong>Tremorsense.</strong> You have 30 feet of
      Tremorsense.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized
      the world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its
      surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient
      Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the
      following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
