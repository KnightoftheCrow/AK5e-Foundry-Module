    value: >-
      <p>Durin are small folk of even smaller stature, with pointed ears and of
      peaceful nature, that hail from the underground of Terra. They resemble
      dwarves of various mythologies, with a penchant for alcohol and
      sensitivity to geography and topology, but notably lack the bulky body
      shape typically associated with those fantastical Species. Durin tend to
      be simple but happy folk, content to take each day as it comes, so long as
      there’s some fun to be had amongst good company. With that said, this
      stagnation chafes at an increasing number of Durin, who are abandoning
      their underground roots for adventure on the surface.</p><p>The
      Underground Durin Cities are paradises in many respects; City-States built
      inside giant biodomes deep under Terra. It is a realm mostly unexplored by
      surface dwellers, as common contact with the Durin is a modern development
      thanks to the invention of the great lifts that connect the cities to the
      surface. Most claim that their migration is due to boredom, but some
      scholars doubt their sincerity in this regard.</p><h1>Durin
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Durin are small folk, averaging
      around 4 feet in height. Equally diminutive is their stature, with
      relatively feeble strength when compared to other races. On average, the
      Durin weigh around 80 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Durin reach adulthood around the age of 18, and have
      a life expectancy of around 300 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 25 feet. However, you are not slowed by Difficult
      Terrain.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Charisma
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Durin Features</h1><p>As a Durin, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><h3>Dwellers of the Underground</h3><p>The Durin live most of
      their lives underground; all of it, in many cases. A majority of life is
      spent within their cities, but it was not always so, as they dwelled
      within the tunnels and caves of the earth. Even now, they maintain that
      old knowledge. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have 30 feet of
      Darkvision.</p><p><strong>Undergrounder.</strong> If you are underground
      or within a building, you have 60 feet of Tremorsense; this Tremorsense
      does not extend outside of the building you are in.</p><h3>Don’t Look Down
      on Me!</h3><p>Durin that venture to the surface often find themselves
      being treated with ‘kid gloves’ as a result of their size and appearance.
      While some are happy to be patronized, others develop something of a
      complex about their height.</p><p>When you deal Damage to a Creature who
      is one or more sizes larger than you, you can cause that Creature to take
      additional Damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus (no Action
      required).</p><p>You can use this Feature a number of times equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you complete a Long
      Rest, and you can use it no more than once per Turn.</p><h3>Hard
      Target</h3><p>The diminutive size of the Durin would, at first glance,
      appear to be a crushing disadvantage in combat. However, in practice, the
      difference in height has an uncanny habit of throwing off their opponents,
      who struggle to keep up.</p><p>Your base Armour Class is equal to 12 +
      your Dexterity Modifier. You can use this base Armour Class even while
      wearing Armour if your Armour Class would be lower than this.</p><h3>Cling
      to the World</h3><p>The Teekaz lost this world to the Ancients long ago,
      and yet they remain; stubbornly clinging to their lives, and their place
      on Terra.</p><p>When you make a Death Saving Throw, you may add your
      Proficiency Bonus to the result of the roll.</p>
