      <p>Cautus are leporid in nature, having the traits of rabbits and hares;
      large ears, short fluffy tails, and generally short stature. They are
      quick and nimble physically, and quick to mature and reproduce when
      compared to many races on Terra. For many Cautus, the family unit is of
      extreme importance to them; they often live communally, and work together
      to construct large multi-generational dwellings. Even when family members
      are away from the rest of their family, it is not uncommon for them to
      receive support (whether material or otherwise) from their family at
      home.</p><p>Many Cautus hail from Rim Billiton, a corporatocratic
      conglomerate formed of many different mines and guilds banded together to
      form a nation. These businesses are family owned and run, due in no small
      part to the familial nature of the Cautuses that make up the majority of
      the population.</p><h1>Cautus Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> You are Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Cautus are
      small, nimble and light, as befitting the creatures they represent; their
      height typically falls between 4 and a half and 5 and a half feet on
      average, weighing in at around 110 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Variant: Smaller
      Stature</strong></p><p>When you choose this species, you can choose for
      your size to be Small. If you do, your base Walking Speed increases by
      5ft, but you cannot wear equipment that isn’t made for someone of your
      size.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Cautus reach
      maturity earlier than other races, reaching adulthood between 12 and 16,
      and living for around 60 years on average.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong>
      Your base Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Dexterity Score increases by 2, and two other
      scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Cautus Features</h1><p>As a
      Cautus, you gain the following benefits:</p><h3>Cautus Luck</h3><p>Is it
      luck, base cunning, or a combination of the two? Regardless of the reason,
      Cautus seem to have a knack for “landing on their feet”, even when they
      have no business doing so.</p><p>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an
      Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw, you can reroll the die and
      must use the new roll.</p><h3>Move First or Move Never</h3><p>Cautus live
      fast in many respects; many on Terra have them beat in terms of raw
      strength or size. In order to match them, the Cautus simply have to be
      faster off the mark, either to run; or to strike.</p><p>When you roll
      Initiative, you may add twice your Dexterity Modifier rather than just
      your Dexterity Modifier.</p><h3>Rabbit’s Leap</h3><p>The Leporid genes of
      the Cautus that have empowered their bodies for speed have had other
      effects; tightly-banded, densely-packed leg musculature ensures a better
      performance to mass ratio than most others are capable of.</p><p>Your Jump
      Height, both for Long Jumps and High Jumps, is doubled.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
