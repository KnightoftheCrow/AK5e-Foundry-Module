      <p>Though often conflated with the similarly canine Perro and Vulpo, any
      comparison swiftly ends with the physical appearance. Lupi have the
      pricked, fluffy ears, bushy tails, and carnivorous fangs of wolves; those
      ancient pack hunters. Unlike the jovial and familial Perros, Lupi are
      typically taciturn and competitive, if not outright combative. Lupo often
      have a twisted relationship with family; they place massive value on
      family identification, often dyeing their fur or wearing icongraphy to
      mark them as a member of particular family. To be excluded from one’s
      family is to be a social pariah; “lone wolf” is a derogatory term for
      these renegades. Despite their prideful association, however, many Lupi
      see their family as competition rather than companions. They fight
      constantly amongst themselves, yet against a rival family, they will band
      together and fight shoulder to shoulder. Also unlike their Perro cousins,
      Lupi tend not to use their ears and tails to communicate, believing it a
      waste of energy.</p><p>Not every Lupo falls under these headings, however.
      The mark of the predator sits heavy on the Lupi; battle is in their blood,
      and they excel at it with relative ease. That does not mean they
      necessarily enjoy the life of conflict forced upon them in their own
      communities, with some choosing to flee to try for a quieter
      life.</p><p>Lupi can be found all over Terra, but without a doubt they are
      most associated with Siracusa; a land run by Lupo Mafia families, under
      the secretive leadership of Signora Sicilia. It is a land with a rich
      culture of art and music, but every brick, every stone, is steeped in
      violence and blood. Larger Lupo populations can also be found in Victoria
      and Leithanien, and less commonly in Columbia and Ursus.</p><h1>Lupo
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A Lupo’s height typically falls in
      the upper regions of 5 to 6 feet, with no discernable difference between
      sexes. Similarly, while they tend to be physically powerful, their muscle
      structure means their forms still remain lithe, weighing in at around 170
      pounds on average. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Lupi reach adulthood around the age of 18, and have a
      life expectancy of around 80 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Strength Score increases by 2, and two other
      scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Lupo Features</h1><p>As a
      Lupo, you gain the following Features:</p><h3>La Forza del Lupo</h3><p>The
      Lupo are hunters, through and through; battle and danger runs in their
      blood like magma, due in part to the influence of the Beast Lords upon
      their society. In and out of combat, the way Lupi move is hard to
      replicate.</p><p>Choose either Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
      (Acrobatics). You gain Proficiency in the chosen skill. If you would gain
      Proficiency in that skill from a non-Species Feature source, you instead
      gain Expertise in that Skill.</p><h3>Odore di Sangue</h3><p>Lupi do not
      allow prey to escape easily; when the scent of blood is in the air, they
      are at their most vicious.</p><p>Once per Turn, when you would make an
      Attack on which you have Advantage against a Creature with less than half
      of its maximum Hit Points remaining, you can cause that Attack to deal 1d8
      additional Damage (no Action required).</p><h3>Zanne del Lupo</h3><p>A
      Lone Wolf is dangerous enough, but a pack of wolves can tear even large
      threats to pieces.</p><p>Your first Attack you make each Turn against a
      Creature is made at Advantage if that Creature is within the Reach of at
      least one of your allies, and that ally is not Incapacitated.</p><p>From
      7th Level, all Attacks you make against a Creature are made at Advantage
      if that Creature is within the Reach of at least one of your allies, and
      that ally is not Incapacitated.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The
      Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since
      spread all over its surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those
      of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose
      one from the following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
