      <p>Vulpo are of average height and build, set apart by their incredible
      sense of hearing and especially smell. They are caniforms, similar to
      Perro and Lupi, but draw their traits from foxes and similar canids. As
      such, large protruding ears and long, brush-like tails set them apart from
      their canid cousins. Even amongst caniforms, the Vulpo have a truly
      incredible sense of smell; almost nothing can escape their notice, though
      this sensitivity does come at the cost of discomfort in particularly
      foul-smelling locations. When combined with their natural agility and
      guile, Vulpo make excellent scouts, messengers, and merchants, and have
      filled these roles since the dawn of Terran civilisation.</p><p>Vulpo are
      a relatively common species, not quite reaching the population levels of
      the Perro, but more populous than some other species and as such, they can
      be found all over Terra. However, like Felines, the Vulpo do not have a
      particular homeland to call their own, though a significant population can
      be found in Siracusa.</p><h1>Vulpo Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Vulpo are
      typically between 5 and 6 feet in height, trending towards the lower end,
      with an average weight of 130lbs. On average, male Vulpo are taller than
      their female counterparts. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Vulpo reach adulthood around the age of 18, and have
      a life expectancy of around 80 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Intelligence Score increases by 2, and two
      other scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Vulpo Features</h1><p>As
      a Vulpo, you gain the following Features:</p><h3>Fox’s Guile</h3><p>Your
      finely tuned ears and nose allow you to ascertain what is and isn’t real.
      You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Skill Expertise.</strong>
      You gain Proficiency in the Investigation Skill. If you would gain
      Proficiency in that skill from a non-Species Feature source, you instead
      gain Expertise in that skill.</p><p><strong>Sniffer Dog.</strong> You have
      Advantage on any Investigation check to see through illusions or
      disguises.</p><h3>Incredible Sense of Smell</h3><p>The Vulpo’s sense of
      smell is so adept, their other senses can sometimes take a
      backseat.</p><p>As long as you have access to your sense of smell, you
      have 20 feet of Blindsight. From 7th level, you can also see Invisible
      Creatures within this range.</p><h3>Inescapable</h3><p>Your sense of smell
      gives you incredible tracking ability. When you focus, you can
      differentiate smells from each other that others aren’t even aware
      exist.</p><p>If you spend 10 minutes examining an area, you can make a
      DC15 Investigation Check. If you pass, you may ask the GM three questions
      about Creatures that have been present in this location in the last week.
      These questions should be things like “How many people were here?”, “Was
      the same person as last time here?”, or “How long ago was someone last
      here?” Regardless, the GM can only answer these Questions with one-word
      answers, or provide a value (such as “three days ago”). If you fail, you
      may only ask one question.</p><p>Once you have used this Feature, you must
      complete a Short Rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
