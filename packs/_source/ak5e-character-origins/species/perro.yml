      <p>Perro are caniforms representing a huge spectrum of different canids
      (notably excluding wolves and hyenas). A Perro’s traits can be seen most
      prevalently in their ears and tails, of which there are countless
      varieties, and less prevalently in their keen sense of smell and
      demeanour. Like the animals from which they take their traits, Perro are
      typically known for their positive attitudes, gregarious nature, and
      irrepressible resolve; often willing to lend a hand, especially towards
      friends and family. In Perro communities, individual families are often
      seen as part of the wider “family” in the community, fostering a culture
      of cooperation and loyalty to this new “family”.</p><p>Many Perro
      originate from Bolivar, but neighbouring Columbia also has a significant
      population. That said, Perro can really be found anywhere in some
      capacity, and their penchant for community usually means you won’t have to
      look far. This willingness to “get stuck in” as it were, alongside others,
      means that Perro are often found on the borderlands of civilisation,
      pushing forward with a smile.</p><h1>Perro Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Perro are
      typically between 5 and 6 feet in height, trending towards the bottom half
      of that bracket. Thanks to their slightly smaller height, their average
      weight is 130 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Perro reach adulthood around the age of 18, and have
      a life expectancy of around 80 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Constitution Score increases by 2, and two
      other scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Perro Features</h1><p>As
      a Perro, you gain the following Features:</p><h3>Can’t Keep Them
      Down</h3><p>The Perro have been through a lot in the recent history of
      Terra. Perhaps, if they were aught else, they would have broken under the
      strain, but as the saying goes; you can’t keep a good dog down.</p><p>When
      you roll a Hit Dice, if the natural result on the dice is less than half
      the maximum possible result on that dice, that roll becomes equal to half
      the maximum roll (I.E If your Hit Dice was 1d12, any natural roll of less
      than a 6 would become a 6).</p><h3>Irrepressible</h3><p>The recent history
      of the Perro is one of war and tragedy, yet their spirits remain unbroken.
      Gregarious, perhaps to a fault, the Perro are personable and always
      willing to lend a hand, even if they disguise this side of them under a
      serious demeanour.</p><p>You may take the Help Action as a Bonus Action.
      Starting at 7th Level, whenever you take the Help Action, your target
      gains Temporary Hit Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus.</p><h3>Survive
      and Adapt</h3><p>Perro can be found all over the world. If there is a
      thread that ties these disparate people together, it is their ingenuity
      and their will to survive.</p><p>When you take Damage from a hostile
      Creature, you can use your Reaction to halve that Damage. Once you use
      this Feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the
      world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its
      surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient
      Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the
      following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
