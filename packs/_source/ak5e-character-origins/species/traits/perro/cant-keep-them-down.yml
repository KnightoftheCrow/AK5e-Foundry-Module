      <h3>Can’t Keep Them Down</h3><p>The Perro have been through a lot in the
      recent history of Terra. Perhaps, if they were aught else, they would have
      broken under the strain, but as the saying goes; you can’t keep a good dog
      down.</p><p>When you roll a Hit Dice, if the natural result on the dice is
      less than half the maximum possible result on that dice, that roll becomes
      equal to half the maximum roll (I.E If your Hit Dice was 1d12, any natural
      roll of less than a 6 would become a 6).</p><p><strong>Can't be
      Automated.</strong></p>
