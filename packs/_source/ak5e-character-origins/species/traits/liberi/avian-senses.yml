      <h3>Avian Senses</h3><p>The Avian Characteristics of Liberi have provided
      them with excellent hearing and eyesight, both for predation, and for
      concealing themselves from predators. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Nothing Beneath Notice.</strong> If you fail a
      Wisdom (Perception) Check that relies upon hearing or sight, you may
      reroll that Check with Advantage.</p><p><strong>Supreme Sight.</strong>
      You can see into Lightly Obscured areas as if they were not Obscured, and
      into Heavily Obscured areas as if they were Lightly
      Obscured.</p><p><strong>Not Automated.</strong></p>
