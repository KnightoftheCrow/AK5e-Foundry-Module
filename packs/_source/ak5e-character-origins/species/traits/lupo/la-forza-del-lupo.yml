      <h3>La Forza del Lupo</h3><p>The Lupo are hunters, through and through;
      battle and danger runs in their blood like magma, due in part to the
      influence of the Beast Lords upon their society. In and out of combat, the
      way Lupi move is hard to replicate.</p><p>Choose either Strength
      (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). You gain Proficiency in the chosen
      skill. If you would gain Proficiency in that skill from a non-Species
      Feature source, you instead gain Expertise in that
      Skill.</p><p><strong>Partially Automated: </strong>This Feature will grant
      you Expertise in the chosen skill if you already have Proficiency in it,
      but will not grant you the expertise if you would later gain it.</p>
