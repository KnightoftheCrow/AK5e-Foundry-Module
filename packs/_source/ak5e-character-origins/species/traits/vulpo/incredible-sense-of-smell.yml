      <h3>Incredible Sense of Smell</h3><p>The Vulpo’s sense of smell is so
      adept, their other senses can sometimes take a backseat.</p><p>As long as
      you have access to your sense of smell, you have 20 feet of Blindsight.
      From 7th level, you can also see Invisible Creatures within this
      range.</p><p><strong>Partially Automated. </strong>Remember to update the
      vision range.</p>
