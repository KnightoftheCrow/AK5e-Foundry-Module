      <h3>Agendum</h3><p>Phidia are notoriously single-minded. That is not to
      say that they are bull-headed or stubborn (though some may accuse them of
      this), but that when they have set themselves on a goal, little short of
      death will sway them from it. Theirs is not the nigh-fanatical obsession
      of the Zalak, but an unrelenting, resolute march.</p><p>When you choose
      this Species, you must also work with your DM to choose an
      Agenda.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What’s an Agenda?</strong></p><p>An
      Agenda is a long-term goal representing the Phidian tendency for
      obsession; an Agenda can be something with a concrete end, such as “I want
      to kill Regent Theresis” or something more abstract, such as “My passion
      is toxicology, and I want to pursue it”. You should consider why this is
      important enough to your character for them to obsess over
      it.</p></blockquote><p>When you perform a Skill Check directly related to
      pursuing your Agenda, you may do so with Advantage. The DM has discretion
      on whether a Skill Check relates to pursuing your Agenda. When you
      complete a major task towards following your Agenda (DM discretion), you
      gain a special Inspiration that only expires when you succeed on a d20
      roll as a result of using it.</p><p>If you complete your Agenda, work with
      your DM to create another one.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:
      Following your Agenda</strong></p><p>If your Agenda was “I want to kill
      Regent Theresis”, then using Intimidation to coerce information out of a
      Sarkaz soldier with no direct connection to the Regent would not count as
      pursuing your Agenda. However, doing the same to an officer who knows
      where you might find the Regent would count.</p><p>Completing a major task
      for this Agenda may involve taking down a officer close to the Regent, or
      interfering with his plans in a major
      way.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Can't be automated.</strong></p>
