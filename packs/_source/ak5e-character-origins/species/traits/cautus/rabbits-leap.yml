      <h3>Rabbit’s Leap</h3><p>The Leporid genes of the Cautus that have
      empowered their bodies for speed have had other effects; tightly-banded,
      densely-packed leg musculature ensures a better performance to mass ratio
      than most others are capable of.</p><p>Your Jump Height, both for Long
      Jumps and High Jumps, is doubled.</p><p><strong>No Automation
      required.</strong></p>
