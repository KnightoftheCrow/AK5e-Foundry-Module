      <h3>In Their Blood</h3><p>Caprinae have a natural affinity for Arts; even
      those who do not choose to pursue it have that might imprinted upon them
      from birth. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Arts
      Proficiency.</strong> You gain Proficiency in the Arts
      Skill.</p><p><strong>Inherent Magic.</strong> Choose one of the Arts Pools
      available to the Caster Class; you learn the Cantrips for that Arts Pool.
      At 7th Level, you learn a 1st Level Art of your choice from the chosen
      Arts Pool; this Art is always prepared, and once per Short Rest you may
      cast it at 1st Level without expending any Arts
      Points.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your Spellcasting
      Ability for these Arts (choose when you gain this Feature). Additionally,
      you do not require a weapon with the Casting Unit Property or Oripathy to
      cast the Arts you gain through this
      Feature.</p><p><strong>Automated.</strong></p>
