      <h3>Divine the Spirits</h3><p>By inquiring into the Nephesh, the spirits
      of long dead Sarkaz, a Cyclopes can seemingly divine the future. As the
      origin of these predictions is itself tragic, however, such tends to
      invite bad luck upon the Cyclopes.</p><p>By conducting a 10 minute ritual,
      you can commune with the collective spirits of all the countless dead
      Sarkaz. For the next minute, you can ask the spirits up to three
      questions. The spirits can only give three possible answers to your
      question; “yes”, “no”, or they can refuse to answer. They are capable of
      speculating about future events, and are relatively up to date on current
      events as each dead Sarkaz adds to their knowledge (For the sake of
      convenience, its safe to say that if an event happened more than a week
      ago, they could know of it). However, they will not know things which they
      could not have known in life, such as well-kept secrets that do not
      concern the Sarkaz, or things no-one was there to witness. Ultimately,
      what the spirits know is down to DM discretion. They are not capable of
      directly lying to you, but their information is always tainted with sorrow
      and rage, and they may attempt to mislead you to satisfy vengeance or
      spite. After the time is up or you have asked three questions, the ritual
      ends.</p><p>You can only use this Feature once per Short Rest.
      Additionally, if you use this Feature, you generate a point of Bad
      Luck.</p>
