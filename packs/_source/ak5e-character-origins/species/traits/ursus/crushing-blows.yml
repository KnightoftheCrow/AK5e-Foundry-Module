      <h3>Crushing Blows</h3><p>Despite not being the largest Species, the
      physical strength of the Ursus is well documented, crushing some foes with
      a single primal blow. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Improved Unarmed Strikes</strong>. Your Unarmed
      Strikes can deal Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength Modifier
      on a hit.</p><p><strong>Proven Strength.</strong> When you roll to
      determine the Damage of a Melee Attack, you may replace the result of one
      of those die with your Strength Modifier. If your Strength Modifier is
      higher than the maximum possible value on that die, instead treat it as if
      you had rolled the maximum for that die.</p><p><strong>Not Automated.
      </strong>Does add an Unarmed Strike Action with the correct Damage.
      However, the Proven Strength aspect is not automated in any way.</p>
