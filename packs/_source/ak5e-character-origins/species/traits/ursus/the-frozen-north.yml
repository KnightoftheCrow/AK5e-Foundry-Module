      <h3>The Frozen North</h3><p>The Ursi originate from snow-blasted wastes
      and tundra with precious little to eat, even in favourable months. They
      have had no choice but to adapt to that environment. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You are
      Resistant to Cold Damage.</p><p><strong>Hunger Resistance.</strong> You
      can go three times as long as normal without food.</p>
