      fine and precise application of Arts.</p><p>You are Proficient in all
      Weapons that have the Firearm Property. You gain a Patron Firearm version
      of one of those Weapons as Starting Equipment (your choice). When wielded
      by a Fallen Sankta, or a non-Sankta, Attacks made with that Patron Firearm
      are made at Disadvantage.</p><p>If you become a Fallen Sankta, you
      maintain your Proficiency with Firearms, but you have Disadvantage when
      using your Patron Firearm.</p><p><strong>Automated.</strong></p>
