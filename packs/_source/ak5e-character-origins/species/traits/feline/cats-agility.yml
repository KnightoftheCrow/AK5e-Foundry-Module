      goes. Whatever the truth, Felines are undoubtedly agile. You gain the

      a Prone position at the cost of 5 feet of Movement.</p><p><strong>Terminal
      Velocity.</strong> Whenever you would take Damage as a result of falling,
      you can use your Reaction to halve the damage you take from that
      fall.</p><p><strong>Not Automated.</strong></p>
