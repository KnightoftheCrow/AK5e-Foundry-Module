      <p>Anura have the traits of frogs and toads, though their animalistic
      traits can be hard to spot, mostly shown in their eyes, and in patches of
      scales over their bodies. Anura internally produce a very potent toxin
      which they can secrete through glands on their neck and back. As such,
      they are often skilled in toxicology and use of these poisons and toxins;
      it is a reputation that precedes them, as many are fearful of the Anura,
      fearing to even touch them, or eat food that they’ve prepared. However,
      the Anura are capable of controlling the toxicity of their poison, and
      thus pose little actual risk.</p><p>The Anura are rare, originating from
      the rainforests of Sargon and Bolivar. These humid, swampy regions suit
      their natural constitution, and thus they sometimes come into contact with
      the Archosaurians who also dwell in these regions. In modern times, some
      Anura are beginning to migrate from their rainforest home into nomadic
      cities; though they still prefer those with abundant greenery and good
      access to water.</p><h1>Anuran Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Anura
      stand between 5 and 5.5 feet, and average 130 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Anura reach adulthood
      around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30 feet.
      You have a Swimming Speed equal to your Walking
      Speed.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Intelligence
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Anuran Features</h1><p>As an Anura, you gain the following
      features:</p><h3>Blood of the Swamp</h3><p>The Anura are naturally toxic,
      and originate from deep, dank swamps full of equally venomous creatures.
      They have developed a strong resistance to all toxins. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><p><strong>Legacy of Venom.</strong> You have
      Advantage on Saving Throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned Condition
      or the effect of any Toxin.</p><p><strong>Poison Resistance.</strong> You
      have Resistance to Poison Damage.</p><p><strong>Self-Toxin
      Immunity.</strong> You are immune to the Damage and Effects of Toxins you
      produce using your Toxin Glands Feature.</p><h3>Toxin Glands</h3><p>The
      Anura can secrete their venom to make use of it in their lives; as such,
      they have a somewhat unsavoury reputation in the wider world outside of
      their tribes. Many are afraid to touch them, to share utensils, or to even
      eat food prepared by them.</p><p>Once per Short Rest, you can secrete 1x
      Cytotoxin as an Action. If this toxin is not used within 10 minutes, it
      becomes inert.</p><p>From 7th Level, you can secrete 1x Neurotoxin
      instead.</p><h3>Partially Amphibious</h3><p>The Anura are not a purely
      water-dwelling people, but they have dwelled in and around water for as
      long as any in their homelands can recall.</p><p>You can hold your breath
      for twice as long as normal.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient
      Species seized the world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread
      all over its surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an
      Ancient Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one
      from the following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
