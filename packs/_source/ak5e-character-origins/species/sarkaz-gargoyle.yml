      <p>Gargoyles, “the children of soil and stone”, are amongst the rarer of
      the Sarkaz tribes. In the modern age, the Gargoyles have been scattered
      all across Terra, living apart or together, but always in a fortified
      location. They appear superficially similar to other Sarkaz; however,
      their horns are often more pronounced, and they have a distinctly bat-like
      aspect, with some even bearing bat-like wings and tails, though those
      wings provide no flight.</p><p>The Gargoyles have a reputation for being
      somewhat taciturn, preferring instead to show appreciation through hard
      labour and gifts; they have been known to give out soil to friends, and a
      stone statue for close partners and relatives. While on the surface a
      strange gift, Gargoyles feel a unique connection to the earth, displaying
      a particular affinity with geokinetic Arts, and possessing a particularly
      strange ability to “talk” to the soil.</p><h1>Sarkaz Gargoyle
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> As the direct descendants of
      the Teekaz, you are a Fiend (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> As
      the Sarkaz are, in reality, a collection of related subspecies joined
      under one heading, their physical size and build can vary greatly.
      Generally speaking, however, they fall between 5 feet and 6 and a half
      feet in height, and around 160 pounds in weight. Male Sarkaz tend to be
      taller and heavier, but it is not a given. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The Sarkaz mature at the
      same rate as many other races, reaching adulthood around 18, but have a
      vastly extended lifespan, able to live for many centuries. Most, however,
      do not live this long; the life of the Sarkaz is hard, fraught with peril,
      and Oripathy can shorten their lifespan dramatically, as it does all
      others.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom and
      Constitution Scores increase by 1, and one other score of your choice
      increases by 1.</p><h1>Sarkaz Gargoyle Features</h1><p>As a Sarkaz
      Gargoyle, you gain the following Features:</p><h3>Nephesh</h3><p>All
      Sarkaz have an intrinsic, genetic connection to the Sarkaz of the past and
      present. The memories of the Sarkaz are embedded in their very genetics,
      allowing modern Sarkaz to recall the events of centuries ago as if they
      were there, under the right conditions. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Ancestral Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you would
      make a Lore Check regarding the history of the Sarkaz, or events that
      directly pertain to it, you are treated as having Expertise in that skill.
      If you already have Expertise, you make that Check at
      Advantage.</p><p><strong>Lifelink.</strong> When a Sarkaz you know dies,
      you immediately become aware of it, though you learn nothing about the
      circumstances.</p><h3>Witchcraft</h3><p>Sarkaz have a tighter bond with
      Originum and the curse of Oripathy than other races, and can wield it to
      destructive effect; both for themselves and their foes.</p><p>You have
      access to the Witchcraft Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz Arts. These Arts are
      always prepared. If you cannot cast Arts in another way, Wisdom is your
      Spellcasting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a weapon with the
      Casting Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><p>Once per Long Rest, you
      can cast a Sarkaz Art without expending any Arts Points. The maximum level
      of Sarkaz Art you can cast in this way is controlled by your Character
      Level. At 7th Level, you can cast Sarkaz Arts in this way twice per Long
      Rest.</p><table><thead><tr><td><p

      Mold Mud and Rock</h3><p>Once per Long Rest, over the course of a ten
      minute ritual, you can create an
      @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-bestiary.Actor.niDFLjZT9tuHPYSR]{Earthen
      Golem}. From 7th Level, you may summon a
      @UUID[Compendium.ak5e.ak5e-bestiary.Actor.oqgc55sHBP7zqsPh]{Earthen
      Colossus} instead. The Construct lasts for 1 hour, or until it reduced to
      0 Hit Points, wherein it crumbles to dust.</p><p>In combat, the Earthen
      Golem takes its Turn immediately after you, and is allied to you and your
      allies. You can communicate with the Golem telepathically up to 1 mile,
      and the Golem attempts to fulfil any order you give it. If you do not
      issue any command, it will use its Turn to attempt to protect
      you.</p><h3>To Speak with Stone</h3><p>How the Gargoyles glean their
      information from the earth and soil, none can truly say. There is no
      denying, however, that sometimes when they speak, a voice only they can
      hear answers, telling them things they should not know.</p><p>You learn
      the Commune with Nature Art. It is always considered Prepared, and you may
      cast it once per Short Rest without expending any Arts Points.
      Furthermore, it is considered to be a Sarkaz Art, no longer has a limited
      range in caves and underground settings, and does not lose function in
      artificial or urban areas, as long as your feet are touching the
      ground.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The Teekaz lost this world to the
      Ancients long ago, and yet they remain; stubbornly clinging to their
      lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When you make a Death Saving Throw,
      you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the result of the roll.</p>
