    value: >-
      <p>Felines are humanoids with Feliform traits, shown prominently in ears,
      tails, eye colour, and teeth structure. Much like their namesake, they
      have a reputation for stealth (if not outright guile). They are the most
      populous race on Terra, able to adapt to any and all circumstances. Such
      is their ubiquity that a Gaulish proverb “Où que tu ailles, un Félin suit
      (Wherever you go, a Feline follows)” has outlived the empire that it
      originated from.</p><p>Despite being one of the most populous races on the
      surface of Terra, Felines have never ruled a land of their own, always
      serving under the banner of another. They are leal and able allies, found
      anywhere and everywhere, but they have never yet had a land to call
      home.</p><h1>Feline Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are
      a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Felines stand between 5 and 6
      feet, and average 140 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Felines reach adulthood around the age of 18, and
      have a life expectancy of around 80 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong>
      Your base Walking Speed is 30 feet. You have a Climbing Speed equal to
      your Walking Speed.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your
      Dexterity Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice
      increase by 1.</p><h1>Feline Features</h1><p>As a Feline, you gain the
      following Features:</p><h3>Cat’s Agility</h3><p>Cats always land on their
      feet, or so the saying goes. Whatever the truth, Felines are undoubtedly
      agile. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>On Your
      Feet.</strong> You can rise from a Prone position at the cost of 5 feet of
      Movement.</p><p><strong>Terminal Velocity.</strong> Whenever you would
      take Damage as a result of falling, you can use your Reaction to halve the
      damage you take from that fall.</p><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>The specially
      adapted eyes of the Felines give you a distinct advantage. You gain 120
      feet of Darkvision. Remember to update the vision range.</p><h3>Natural
      Skulkers</h3><p>Felines are naturally adapted to quiet, stealthy movement.
      Even the most heavyfooted Feline can be far stealthier than they have any
      right to be. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Footpad.</strong> Whenever you make a Stealth
      Check, if the on the d20 is less than your Proficiency Bonus, it becomes
      equal to your Proficiency Bonus.</p><p><strong>Stealth
      Proficiency.</strong> You gain Proficiency in Stealth.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
