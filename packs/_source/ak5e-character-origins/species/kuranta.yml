    value: >-
      <p>Kuranta are fast and potent fighters, running down their foes in a blur
      of speed and moving to the next without pause. Their strength and speed
      come from the animals they inherit from; equines. Tall of stature, bearing
      funnel-shaped ears and long-haired tails, they lack the raw strength of
      Ursi or Forte, but none can match a Kuranta for stamina.</p><p>Most
      Kuranta originate from Kazimierz; a land torn between traditionalist
      feudal beliefs and modern capitalism. As such, many Kuranta subscribe to
      one of these ideals, of the old honour, or the new progress. Of course,
      some choose a different path; a middle path, or neither
      path.</p><h1>Kuranta Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are
      a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Kuranta are marginally taller
      than some other races, clocking in between 5 and a half and 6 feet on
      average, but pack a lot of dense muscle into their frames; thus, they
      weigh about 190 pounds on average. Their size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Kuranta reach adulthood
      around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Constitution
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Kuranta Features</h1><p>As a Kuranta, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Ever Onward</h3><p>No matter their destiny, no matter
      their objective, no matter how hopeless; the Kuranta charge
      onwards.</p><p>When you would be subjected to an effect that would
      decrease your Speed or prevent you from moving, you may expend 1d8 Hit
      Points as a Reaction to ignore that aspect of the effect. All other
      aspects of the triggering effect (such as Damage dealt, and other
      Conditions) are applied as normal.</p><h3>Run Them Down</h3><p>Kuranta are
      naturally suited to battle by their stunning speed, opening up the
      opportunities for those lightning fast clashes that make the Kuranta
      Knights of Kazimierz so enthralling to watch.</p><p>You may take the Dash
      Action as a Bonus Action; when you do so using this Feature, you lose 1d8
      Hit Points.</p><h3>Until the Last Breath</h3><p>Kuranta are skilled
      fighters; this is something everybody knows. When you see their blinding
      speed and bravery, it is easy to assume those are the only reasons. Under
      the skin, however, the hidden engine of their power pulses hot; they don’t
      have to beat you, just outlast you.</p><p>You may activate this Feature as
      a Bonus Action; for the next minute you gain 1d6 + your Constitution
      Modifier (minimum of 1) Temporary Hit Points at the beginning of each of
      your Turns. Once you have used this Feature, you may not do so again until
      you have completed a Long Rest.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The
      Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since
      spread all over its surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those
      of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose
      one from the following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p><p></p>
