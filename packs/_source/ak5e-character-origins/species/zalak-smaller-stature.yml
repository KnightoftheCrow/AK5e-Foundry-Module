      <p>Small, slight, nimble, cunning; the heritage of rodents and
      rodent-adjacent animals shines bright in the Zalak. Much like the Perro,
      there is a great degree of variation amongst Zalak, much of which is
      regional. Pointed and rounded ears, thin whip-like tails and bushy tails,
      even the general thickness of their fur can vary from individual to
      individual. What they do have in common is their short stature, high
      fertility, and disposition. Thanks to the aforementioned high fertility,
      Zalak populations continue to explode in the wake of modern medicine. What
      was once a method to ensure that some children survived the wilds is now
      resulting in a rapid growth of Zalak families in places such as Kazimierz,
      Columbia, or Rim Billiton.</p><p>While the physical prowess of the Zalak
      might be nothing to write home about, it is their mental strengths (and
      pitfalls) that set them apart from other Species, allowing them to compete
      in a field of predators. They possess a naturally nervous disposition, and
      are always on high alert, even amongst friends. The stress of this
      hyper-awareness leads to their second characteristic; Zalak are obsessive,
      picking a goal or concept or a person and devoting themselves to it. For
      some, this allows them to accomplish great things; for others, it can
      destroy them and others. For many years, this “Zalak Syndrome” as it is
      called was used as a derogatory descriptor of their obsessive, preparatory
      tendencies, but gradually has been rebranded through the Columbian Film
      Industry into a positive idiom for one who prepares ahead of
      time.</p><h1>Zalak Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Your
      Creature Type is Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Zalak stand
      between 4.5 and 5.5 feet, typically towards the lower end of that bracket,
      and average 110 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Zalak reach reach maturity earlier than other races,
      reaching adulthood between 12 and 16, and living for around 60 years on
      average.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Dexterity
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Variant: Smaller Stature</strong></p><p>When
      you choose this species, you can choose for your size to be Small. If you
      do, your base Walking Speed increases by 5ft, but you cannot wear
      equipment that isn’t made for someone of your
      size.</p></blockquote><h1>Zalak Features</h1><p>As a Zalak, you gain the
      following Features:</p><h3>Hyperfocus</h3><p>Zalak are difficult to catch
      off guard, but even harder to pin down when they are the ones dictating
      the flow of action. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Hair
      Trigger.</strong> During your Turn:</p><ul><li><p>You have Advantage on
      Saving Throws against effects you can see, or against
      traps</p></li><li><p>Any Attack Roll made against you is made at
      Disadvantage.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Spring-Loaded.</strong> When you
      fail a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw against an effect you can see,
      you can reroll that Saving Throw, but must use the new result. If this
      causes you to pass, and if you would take Half Damage as a result of
      passing that Saving Throw, you instead take no Damage. Once you have used
      this Feature, you cannot do so again until you have completed a Short
      Rest.</p><h3>Nervous Disposition</h3><p>The alert nature of the Zalak is
      well documented. Their senses perpetually scan for threats, practically
      autonomously, granting them awareness others can only dream of. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Avoidant.</strong> You cannot be
      Surprised while you are not Incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Aware.</strong>
      You have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.</p><h3>Prey
      Sense</h3><p>The Zalak have always been prey, not predator, and they
      intrinsically know how best to conceal themselves.</p><p>When you take the
      Hide Action, you can immediately use your Bonus Action to grant yourself a
      +5 Bonus to that Dexterity (Stealth) Check.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
