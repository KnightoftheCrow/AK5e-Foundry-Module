      <p>Vampires, at least on first examination, have little in common with
      other Sarkaz. They possess no horns, no tail, and no scales. Extremely
      pale skin is considered to be a common trait of Vampires by outsiders, but
      while it is a characteristic of some, many more have normal complexions.
      All Vampires, however, possess their characteristic ruby red eyes, shining
      in the darkness with an alarming lustre. As a result, some call Vampires
      “Red Eye” or “Pink Eye”, but many amongst the Vampires consider this to be
      an insult.</p><p>Beyond the physical however, is the ability to interact
      with blood in unique, often disturbing ways; they are capable of
      hematophagia to sustain themselves, and for pleasure, though it is not
      required for them to survive. Outside of consuming blood, they wield
      blood-related Arts to “bless” their allies, augmenting their capabilites,
      normally at the cost of that person’s wellbeing.</p><h1>Sarkaz Vampire
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> As the direct descendants of
      the Teekaz, you are a Fiend (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> As
      the Sarkaz are, in reality, a collection of related subspecies joined
      under one heading, their physical size and build can vary greatly.
      Generally speaking, however, they fall between 5 feet and 6 and a half
      feet in height, and around 160 pounds in weight. Male Sarkaz tend to be
      taller and heavier, but it is not a given. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The Sarkaz mature at the
      same rate as many other races, reaching adulthood around 18, but have a
      vastly extended lifespan, able to live for many centuries. Most, however,
      do not live this long; the life of the Sarkaz is hard, fraught with peril,
      and Oripathy can shorten their lifespan dramatically, as it does all
      others.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom Score
      increases by 1, and one other score of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Sarkaz Vampire Features</h1><p>As a Sarkaz Vampire, you gain the
      following Features:</p><h3>Nephesh</h3><p>All Sarkaz have an intrinsic,
      genetic connection to the Sarkaz of the past and present. The memories of
      the Sarkaz are embedded in their very genetics, allowing modern Sarkaz to
      recall the events of centuries ago as if they were there, under the right
      conditions. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Ancestral
      Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you would make a Lore Check regarding the
      history of the Sarkaz, or events that directly pertain to it, you are
      treated as having Expertise in that skill. If you already have Expertise,
      you make that Check at Advantage.</p><p><strong>Lifelink.</strong> When a
      Sarkaz you know dies, you immediately become aware of it, though you learn
      nothing about the circumstances.</p><h3>Witchcraft</h3><p>Sarkaz have a
      tighter bond with Originum and the curse of Oripathy than other races, and
      can wield it to destructive effect; both for themselves and their
      foes.</p><p>You have access to the Witchcraft Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz
      Arts. These Arts are always prepared. If you cannot cast Arts in another
      way, Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a
      weapon with the Casting Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><p>Once per
      Long Rest, you can cast a Sarkaz Art without expending any Arts Points.
      The maximum level of Sarkaz Art you can cast in this way is controlled by
      your Character Level. At 7th Level, you can cast Sarkaz Arts in this way
      twice per Long Rest.</p><table><thead><tr><td><p

      Magic</h3><p>The mastery of the Vampires over blood doesn’t just end with
      consuming it; they possess Arts that allow them to manipulate it to
      support their allies and debilitate their foes.</p><p>You have access to
      the Blood Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz Arts. If you do not have the Ability
      to cast Arts in another way, Wisdom is your Arts Casting Ability; you do
      not need a weapon with the Casting Unit Property to cast these
      Arts.</p><h3>Haematophage</h3><p>As per their namesake, the Vampires of
      the Sarkaz are capable of drinking blood to sustain themselves; it is
      enjoyable to do so, even pleasurable, but it is not necessary to
      survive.</p><p>As an Action, you can choose a Creature you can see within
      5 foot of you, except yourself, that is any of the following and drain
      blood from
      them:</p><ul><li><p>Willing</p></li><li><p>Stunned</p></li><li><p>Incapacitated</p></li><li><p>Grappled
      by you</p></li><li><p>Restrained</p></li></ul><p>You cannot use this
      Feature against any Creature without blood, such as Undead or
      Constructs.</p><p>When you drain blood from a Creature, that Creature
      loses 2d10 Hit Points; if the Creature was willing, they instead lose 1d10
      Hit Points. Additionally, you gain a special Bloody Inspiration that you
      can possess alongside normal Inspiration. Unlike normal Inspiration, this
      Bloody Inspiration only expires when you succeed on a roll as a result of
      Bloody Inspiration. You can only have one Bloody Inspiration at a
      time.</p><p>From 7th Level, when you take the Attack Action, you can
      replace one of your Attacks with a use of this Feature if the other
      conditions are met.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The Teekaz lost this
      world to the Ancients long ago, and yet they remain; stubbornly clinging
      to their lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When you make a Death
      Saving Throw, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the result of the
      roll.</p>
