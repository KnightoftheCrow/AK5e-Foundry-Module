      <p>Ursi (Singular: Ursus) are the largest and most physically powerful of
      all the caniform representatives amongst the Ancient Races, having the
      traits of bears. This can be most clearly seen in their rounded ears,
      short rounded tails, and the previously mentioned powerful build.
      Originating from the frigid north, their resilience to these conditions
      baffles people not from those climes, a fact that the Ursus typically lord
      over the southerners. Ursus tend to emphasise their physical strength,
      preferring work that allows them to best put it to use rather than more
      learned pursuits. Of course, there are those who buck such trends,
      preferring to use their brain rather than their muscles. Even amongst
      those people, however, the strength of the Ursi is not something to be
      ignored; the most bookish Ursus can throw a punch to put a prize fighter
      to shame.</p><p>Most Ursi hail from the nation they gave their name to,
      the Ursus Empire; a cold and hostile land that plays home to a cold and
      hostile state; expansionist and militaristic. Ursi then, have a certain
      reputation that precedes them, but they are not all grim-faced imperial
      loyalists by any stretch of the imagination. Other populations of Ursus
      can be found in lands more southerly than Ursus (but still geographically
      northern) such as Yan, Kjerag, and Kazimierz.</p><h1>Ursus
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Ursi are on average between five
      and six feet in height, trending towards the upper half of that range.
      There is no difference in average height between males and females of the
      race. Their dense musculature makes them heavier than others their size,
      clocking in around 180 pounds on average. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Ursi reach adulthood
      around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Strength
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Ursus Features</h1><p>As an Ursus, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Blood of Ursus</h3><p>Ursus is a grim place at the best
      of times, and this has left its mark on its people; they are
      stereotypically taciturn, and when they do joke, they are prone to gallows
      humour or flippancy. Let none doubt their efficacy and resilience,
      however; Ursi can grit their teeth and bear situations that would reduce
      others to ruin.</p><p>During your Turn, you can end the Frightened
      Condition on yourself as an Action.</p><h3>Crushing Blows</h3><p>Despite
      not being the largest Species, the physical strength of the Ursus is well
      documented, crushing some foes with a single primal blow. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><p><strong>Improved Unarmed Strikes</strong>. Your
      Unarmed Strikes can deal Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength
      Modifier on a hit.</p><p><strong>Proven Strength.</strong> When you roll
      to determine the Damage of a Melee Attack, you may replace the result of
      one of those die with your Strength Modifier. If your Strength Modifier is
      higher than the maximum possible value on that die, instead treat it as if
      you had rolled the maximum for that die.</p><h3>The Frozen
      North</h3><p>The Ursi originate from snow-blasted wastes and tundra with
      precious little to eat, even in favourable months. They have had no choice
      but to adapt to that environment. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You are Resistant to
      Cold Damage.</p><p><strong>Hunger Resistance.</strong> You can go three
      times as long as normal without food.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
