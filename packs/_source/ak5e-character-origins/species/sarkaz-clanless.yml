      <p>The most common type of Sarkaz, and what most think of when considering
      the Sarkaz, they are not technically a tribe of their own, instead formed
      from the melting pot of millennia of blood-mixing. Pointed ears, horns,
      and tails are their hallmarks. While they might not be specialists like
      other Tribes, and certainly no pure-blood, this does not mean they are
      weak, far from it; they are the most ubiquitous for a reason. They
      survive, and they adapt; no matter the warzone, no matter the conflict,
      the Sarkaz preserve. Like most Sarkaz, they can often be found eking out a
      life on the fringes of non-Sarkaz society, doing whatever that society
      will allow them to do to survive. They are often exempt from social
      welfare, and might even be subject to outright exploitation or apartheid
      policy; as such, mercenary work is where many Sarkaz eventually end up.
      There, at least their lives are in their own hands.</p><h1>Sarkaz Clanless
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> As the direct descendants of
      the Teekaz, you are a Fiend (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> As
      the Sarkaz are, in reality, a collection of related subspecies joined
      under one heading, their physical size and build can vary greatly.
      Generally speaking, however, they fall between 5 feet and 6 and a half
      feet in height, and around 160 pounds in weight. Male Sarkaz tend to be
      taller and heavier, but it is not a given. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The Sarkaz mature at the
      same rate as many other races, reaching adulthood around 18, but have a
      vastly extended lifespan, able to live for many centuries. Most, however,
      do not live this long; the life of the Sarkaz is hard, fraught with peril,
      and Oripathy can shorten their lifespan dramatically, as it does all
      others.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom and
      Constitution Scores increase by 1, and one other score of your choice
      increases by 1.</p><h1>Sarkaz Clanless Features</h1><p>As a Sarkaz
      Clanless, you gain the following Features:</p><h3>Nephesh</h3><p>All
      Sarkaz have an intrinsic, genetic connection to the Sarkaz of the past and
      present. The memories of the Sarkaz are embedded in their very genetics,
      allowing modern Sarkaz to recall the events of centuries ago as if they
      were there, under the right conditions. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Ancestral Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you would
      make a Lore Check regarding the history of the Sarkaz, or events that
      directly pertain to it, you are treated as having Expertise in that skill.
      If you already have Expertise, you make that Check at
      Advantage.</p><p><strong>Lifelink.</strong> When a Sarkaz you know dies,
      you immediately become aware of it, though you learn nothing about the
      circumstances.</p><h3>Witchcraft</h3><p>Sarkaz have a tighter bond with
      Originum and the curse of Oripathy than other races, and can wield it to
      destructive effect; both for themselves and their foes.</p><p>You have
      access to the Witchcraft Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz Arts. These Arts are
      always prepared. If you cannot cast Arts in another way, Wisdom is your
      Spellcasting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a weapon with the
      Casting Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><p>Once per Long Rest, you
      can cast a Sarkaz Art without expending any Arts Points. The maximum level
      of Sarkaz Art you can cast in this way is controlled by your Character
      Level. At 7th Level, you can cast Sarkaz Arts in this way twice per Long
      Rest.</p><table><thead><tr><td><p

      Survivors</h3><p>The life of a Sarkaz is not an easy one; war and conflict
      plagues them across the world, and they are needled by discrimination and
      Oripathy in the few places safe from war. To be a Sarkaz is to fight on,
      even when you should fall.</p><p>When you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points
      but not killed outright, you can instead be reduced to to 1 Hit Point.
      Once you have used this Feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a Long Rest.</p><h3>Ties that Bind</h3><p>The Clanless Sarkaz, as
      a perhaps due to their very nature, have a stronger connection to the
      genetic memory of their people, and can use it to tap into their
      ancestors’ knowledge when required; you just need to ask for help, and be
      prepared to bear their abuse.</p><p>You can cast the Guidance Art without
      a Casting Unit, but only on yourself. When you cast this Art in this way,
      you ignore its Somatic Components.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The
      Teekaz lost this world to the Ancients long ago, and yet they remain;
      stubbornly clinging to their lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When
      you make a Death Saving Throw, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the
      result of the roll.</p>
