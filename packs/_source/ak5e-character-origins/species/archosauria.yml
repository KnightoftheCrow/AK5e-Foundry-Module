      title: Choose Thick or Thin Tail
      hint: Thick Tails scale with Strength; Thin Tails with Dexterity.
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With long, armour-scaled tails, scales found elsewhere upon their body,
      and their long, pointed ears, the Archosaurians cast a unique silhouette.
      The animals they inherit from are crocodilians, complete with their
      strength and endurance. They are not just physically imposing, but also
      socially; Archosaurians often have “larger than life” personalities, and
      are quick to jump to casual violence and competition. They do not
      typically do this out of malice, however, as even these fights are
      friendly; though they will not look that way to outsiders, and certainly
      not to any non-Archosaurs who are involved.</p><p>Archosaurians also have
      a large degree of sexual dimorphism present in their race, with males
      being much more scaled and anthropomorphic than their female counterparts.
      They primarily hail from the tribes of Acahualla, in Sargon, where the
      culture emphasises strength and skill as virtues; that is not to say they
      look down upon intellectual pursuits, though they often pursue them for
      the sake of martial benefit.</p><p>While not the most common Species on
      Terra, Archosauria can be found en masse in the rainforests of Sargon,
      especially in the region known as Acahualla. Their insular, tribal society
      means that it is rare (but not unheard of) for an Acahuallan to venture
      forth from the forests, but this is becoming more common as the world
      continues to advance, and the Acahuallans are drawn into the modern
      world.</p><h1>Archosaurian Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong>
      You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Archosaurians tend to be
      quite short in stature, falling between five and five and a half feet,
      typically. Their size belies their strength, however, and heavy tails mean
      they are deceptively heavy, at around 170 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Archosauria reach
      adulthood around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Strength
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Archosaurian Features</h1><p>As an Archosauria, you gain the
      following Features:</p><h3>Exult in Violence</h3><p>Archosaurians have a
      very cavalier attitude to violence, with it often forming a casual part of
      their life. As such, they are more used to being on the receiving end of
      blows than they perhaps should be.</p><p>When you are hit by an Attack,
      you may use your Reaction to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d6 + your
      Constitution Modifier (minimum of 1).</p><p>You can use this Feature a
      number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended
      uses when you complete a Long Rest.</p><h3>Reckless</h3><p>Archosaurians
      tend towards loud, bombastic personalities and an exaltation of strength
      and violence. They are not bloodthirsty, but they will dive into a fight
      with unconcealed relish to swing their fists.</p><p>Whenever a Creature
      within your Reach is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you may use your Reaction to
      move up to half your Speed towards a hostile Creature you can
      see.</p><h3>Tail Strike</h3><p>Archosaurians continue to argue whether it
      is better to have a thick tail or a thin tail; regardless, it is an
      effective weapon.</p><p>When you select this Species, choose either a
      Thick Tail or a Thin Tail. Both options allow you to use your tail to make
      Unarmed Strikes, which deals 1d6 + your Ability Modifier in Bludgeoning
      Damage, instead of the normal Bludgeoning Damage for an Unarmed
      Strike.</p><ul><li><p>If you choose a Thick Tail, these Tail Strikes use
      your Strength Bonus for the Attack and Damage rolls.</p></li><li><p>If you
      choose a Thin Tail, they instead use your Dexterity Bonus for the Attack
      and Damage rolls.</p></li></ul><p>From 7th Level, you may make an Unarmed
      Strike using your tail as a Bonus Action.</p><h3>Ancient
      Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the
      Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to all its climes and
      domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not
      seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits when you select
      this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level
      thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
