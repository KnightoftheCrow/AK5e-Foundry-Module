    value: >-
      <p>Once upon a time, the Sankta did not exist at all, and those that would
      become Sankta were simply Sarkaz; or the Teekaz, as they were then known.
      It was the discovery of The Law, a god-like, near-omnipotent computer
      intelligence that transformed its discoverers into the first Sankta, and
      it is The Law that binds them now. The Sankta have the traits of abrahamic
      angels, complete with glowing wings and a halo. They cannot fly with these
      wings, but they and the halo are both physical objects, and clothes must
      be designed around them. Their halo grants them a “sixth sense” of
      “empathy”, which allows them to feel the emotions of nearby
      Sankta.</p><p>However, a Sankta can fall from grace if they act against
      The Law’s wishes, cracking their halo and wings, and regrowing the
      devil-esque horns and tails of their Sarkaz cousins, in addition to losing
      their “Empathy” and the ability to use their Patron Firearm. They are
      known simply as Fallen. The decree of The Law is to preserve the existence
      of the Sankta, and by extension Laterano. With that in mind, what exactly
      causes a Sankta to fall is determined by The Law without clear definition,
      but any of the following are likely to cause a fall;</p><ul><li><p>Using
      your Patron Firearm to attack another Sankta.</p></li><li><p>Stealing from
      Lateran citizens.</p></li><li><p>Causing harm, or through inaction
      allowing harm, to Laterano or the Sankta as a
      whole.</p></li><li><p>Refusing to aid or save Sankta when the opportunity
      presents, in favour of other goals.</p></li></ul><p>Sankta almost
      universally originate from Laterano, which is a theocratic nation with The
      Law at its centre, and a Pope as its de jure head. This is because Sankta
      can only be born from two Sankta parents, except in rare circumstances
      that are permitted by The Law. A child with a Sankta parent and a parent
      of another Species will thus almost unilaterally be born as the species of
      the non-Sankta parent. As most Sankta are faithful adherents of The Law,
      most live in Laterano.</p><h1>Sankta Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> As one of those uplifted by The Law, you are a Celestial
      (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Sankta typically fall in the
      upper ranges of five to 6 feet in terms of height, and have an average
      weight of around 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> As members of the Teekaz, the lifespan of the Sankta
      is extended beyond what many races on Terra can hope for. However,
      possibly due to the effects The Law has had on them, they do not have the
      ludicrous lifespans of the Sarkaz cousins. They reach maturity around 18
      years old, and can live for over a hundred years, though not not as far as
      200.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Dexterity
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Sankta Features</h1><p>As a Sankta, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Empathy</h3><p>The ascension of the Sankta by The Law
      granted them their wings, and their halos. It is these halos that bind
      them together, in an almost literal sense.</p><p>Your Law-granted traits
      allow you to access the sixth sense of the Sankta, known as Empathy. You
      can feel the emotions of any non-fallen Sankta within a number of feet of
      you equal to 10 times your Character Level, as they can for you. You can
      use this to facilitate very rudimentary communication; focusing on a
      particular emotion or feeling will allow you to convey that feeling to
      Sankta within your range (Mechanically, for other Sankta, you can
      communicate telepathically with them, but only in terms of emotions, such
      as Fear, Anger, Unsure, etc)</p><p>Additionally, you gain a +10 Modifier
      on Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Persuasion), and Charisma (Intimidation)
      Checks against non-Fallen Sankta.</p><p>If you become a Fallen Sankta, you
      lose access to this Feature.</p><h3>Lawbringers</h3><p>The Sankta tend to
      prefer ranged combat, not out of cowardice, but because that is where they
      can best apply their frightening accuracy.</p><p>When you make an Attack
      Roll using a Weapon you are Proficient with or as part of an Art, you may
      choose to double your Proficiency Bonus for that Attack Roll.</p><p>You
      can use this Feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus,
      regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest, and may only do
      so once per Attack.</p><h3>Legacy of the Law</h3><p>Firearms are a major
      feature of Lateran faith, and the Sankta are the best at using them,
      skilled as they are in fine and precise application of Arts.</p><p>You are
      Proficient in all Weapons that have the Firearm Property. You gain a
      Patron Firearm version of one of those Weapons as Starting Equipment (your
      choice). When wielded by a Fallen Sankta, or a non-Sankta, Attacks made
      with that Patron Firearm are made at Disadvantage.</p><p>If you become a
      Fallen Sankta, you maintain your Proficiency with Firearms, but you have
      Disadvantage when using your Patron Firearm.</p><h3>Cling to the
      World</h3><p>The Teekaz lost this world to the Ancients long ago, and yet
      they remain; stubbornly clinging to their lives, and their place on
      Terra.</p><p>When you make a Death Saving Throw, you may add your
      Proficiency Bonus to the result of the
      roll.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fallen Sankta Feature:
      Scorn</strong></p><p>If you become a Fallen Sankta, you lose access to
      your Empathy Feature and are rejected by your Patron Firearm. In return,
      you gain the following Feature:</p><p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>If
      you become a Fallen Sankta, replace your Species with the Fallen Sankta
      Species.</p><h3>Scorn</h3><p>Regardless of the reason for their fall,
      Fallen Sankta have plenty of experience from their previous life of
      controlling their thoughts and feelings. They can channel their hate,
      their anger, and their fear; woe betide anyone who brushes their mind
      against it. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Mental
      Fortress.</strong> You have Advantage on Saving Throws against effects
      that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts, or control your
      mind.</p><p><strong>Mental Inversion.</strong> Whenever you succeed on an
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma Saving Throw, you can use your Reaction
      to inflict Psychic Damage equal to your Character Level to the Creature
      that was the source of that Saving Throw.</p></blockquote>
