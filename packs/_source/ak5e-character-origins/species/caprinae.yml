      <p>If battle runs in the blood of the Lupi, Arts must run in the blood of
      the Caprinae. They have the traits of goats and sheep, notably including
      curved horns like a ram for both sexes. Some of the most prolific and
      powerful Arts Casters in the history of Terra have been Caprinae,
      including the late Witch King, and Caprinae Casters are often leaders in
      their respective fields. The horns of a Caprinae are integral to their
      identity; even amongst other horned Species such as Forte, Elafians, or
      Sarkaz, Caprinae tend to put the most stock into their horns, caring for
      them as part of their appearance as many others would their hair. For most
      (but not all) Caprinae, to lose their horns would be a most mortal
      blow.</p><p>Many Caprinae originate from Leithanien, a land that
      constantly seeks to further the study of Originium Arts, and even actively
      discriminates against those who cannot wield Arts. However, large
      populations can also be found in surrounding terrorites such as Victoria
      and Siracusa, where they are highly valued for their talent in both
      Originium and performing Arts.</p><h1>Caprinae
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Caprinae reach adulthood around the
      age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80 years. They weigh
      around 150 pounds on average; your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Caprinae reach adulthood around the age of 18, and
      have a life expectancy of around 80 years. They weigh around 160 pounds on
      average.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom Score
      increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Caprinae Features</h1><p>As a Caprinae, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Arts Resistance</h3><p>The inherent affinity of Caprinae
      with Arts does not just apply to their use, but also defence against
      them.</p><p>When you would make a Saving Throw against an Art or Art-like
      effect, you can make that Saving Throw with Advantage.</p><p>Once you use
      this Feature, you may not use it again until you finish a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><h3>Fine Tuning</h3><p>Perhaps due to their natural affinity for
      Arts tuning them into the flow of things at a subconscious level, Caprinae
      can place their blows and their Arts to achieve maximum effect.</p><p>Once
      per Turn, when you roll to determine the Damage you deal, or the Hit
      Points you restore with an Art, you can roll one additional die and
      discard the die with the lowest result.</p><h3>In Their
      Blood</h3><p>Caprinae have a natural affinity for Arts; even those who do
      not choose to pursue it have that might imprinted upon them from birth.
      You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Arts Proficiency.</strong>
      You gain Proficiency in the Arts Skill.</p><p><strong>Inherent
      Magic.</strong> Choose one of the Arts Pools available to the Caster
      Class; you learn the Cantrips for that Arts Pool. At 7th Level, you learn
      a 1st Level Art of your choice from the chosen Arts Pool; this Art is
      always prepared, and once per Short Rest you may cast it at 1st Level
      without expending any Arts Points.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      is your Spellcasting Ability for these Arts (choose when you gain this
      Feature). Additionally, you do not require a weapon with the Casting Unit
      Property or Oripathy to cast the Arts you gain through this
      Feature.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the
      world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its
      surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient
      Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the
      following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
