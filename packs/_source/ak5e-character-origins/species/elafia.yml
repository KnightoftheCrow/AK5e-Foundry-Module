      <p>Elafia are deer-folk, bearing large antlers and a tendency for
      wanderlust. As befitting their status as wanderers, Elafians tend to have
      a natural knack for learning, able to very quickly pick up new skills and
      new jobs to serve themselves and others as they wander. Whether they
      wander or not, Elafia tend to be fiercely individualistic, greatly
      reluctant to rely upon anyone except themselves. For some, this can come
      across as abrasive or unfriendly, while in others it manifests as a
      distance between themselves and others. That is not to say they are
      incapable of vulnerability, however.</p><p>As befitting their nature as
      wanderers, Elafians can be found all over Terra. The largest population of
      them, however, is found in icy Sami; anthropologists believe it might have
      been their original homeland, in a time long passed.</p><h1>Elafian
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Elafia are naturally tall, even
      excluding their antlers, clocking in between 5 and a half and 6 and a half
      feet in height. Despite their height, their physique is not ordinarily
      notable, and thus they weigh around 170 pounds on average. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Elafia reach adulthood
      around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of around 80
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> One Score of your
      choice increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Elafian Features</h1><p>As an Elafia, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Jack-of-Trades</h3><p>Perhaps it comes from their Sami
      ancestry, but Elafia are prone to wanderlust. It is useful then, that they
      find it easy to learn new skills and adapt on the fly to wherever their
      travels and travails take them.</p><p>You may add half of your Proficiency
      Bonus (rounding up) to all Checks made for Skills you are not Proficient
      in.</p><h3>Lock Horns</h3><p>In a more primitive past, the horns of the
      Elafia were used for both defence and intraspecies competition. Thus, the
      frontal bone and crown of the Elafian skull has been reinforced by thick
      bone, to better facilitate this crashing and bashing. An Elafia can be
      unarmed, but they are never defenceless.</p><p>You can use your horns, or
      at least your rock-hard skull, to make an Unarmed Strike. You can use
      Dexterity instead of Strength for the Attack and Damage Rolls. On hit,
      they deal Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1d4 + Ability Modifier instead of
      the normal Damage.</p><p>Additionally, if you hit a Creature no more than
      one size larger than you with an Attack using your horns, that Creature
      must make a Strength Saving Throw against your Martial DC. On a failed
      save, you push that Creature 20 feet directly away from you. On a
      successful save, you push them up to 10 feet away from you.</p><p>Once you
      have attacked with your horns, you cannot do so again until the beginning
      of your next Turn.</p><h3>Pure Identity</h3><p>Whatever else you may say
      about the Elafia, they are fiercely individualistic, clinging to their
      desires, beliefs and goals regardless of what may befall them. It would
      take a Catastrophe to sway them from their course.</p><p>You are
      considered to be Proficient in any Saving Throw to avoid or end the
      Charmed Condition or any other effect that would force you to act against
      your will. If you are already Proficient in that Saving Throw, your
      Proficiency Bonus is doubled for the purpose of that Saving
      Throw.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the
      world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its
      surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient
      Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the
      following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable</strong>. You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious</strong>. You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
