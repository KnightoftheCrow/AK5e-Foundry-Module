    value: >-
      <p>Liberi are the second most populous race on Terra (depending on who you
      ask, they may be the most populous). They have spread to its four corners,
      and can be found in almost every society, in every social strata; they are
      generalists, not possessed of extreme strength and speed of some Species,
      but possessing a little of everything, with a dash of natural charm. They
      possess the traits of birds and other avian beings, though these traits
      are often subtle, and hard to generalise; some have feathers in and
      amongst their hair, others tail feathers and plumage, others still who’s
      arms are almost wing-like. A generalised trait possessed by many Liberi,
      and the one that they are most famous for, is their spectacular eyesight
      and hearing.</p><p>Liberi can be found all over the world, but a notably
      large population exists within Iberia, as it is nation founded by Liberi
      expatriates from neighbouring Laterano. Outside of Iberia’s haunting
      shores, large populations still exist within Laterano itself, but also
      within Columbia; many of the original immigrants to the newly-independent
      Columbia were Liberi, driven to perhaps quite literally spread their wings
      in this new land of opportunity.</p><h1>Liberi
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A Liberi’s height often falls
      between 5 and five and a half feet, though male Liberi can be taller than
      this, sometimes reaching over 6 feet. They weigh in at around 140 pounds
      on average. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong>
      Liberi reach adulthood around the age of 18, and have a life expectancy of
      around 80 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Charisma
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Liberi Features</h1><p>As a Liberi, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><h3>Avian Senses</h3><p>The Avian Characteristics of Liberi
      have provided them with excellent hearing and eyesight, both for
      predation, and for concealing themselves from predators. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><p><strong>Nothing Beneath Notice.</strong> If you
      fail a Wisdom (Perception) Check that relies upon hearing or sight, you
      may reroll that Check with Advantage.</p><p><strong>Supreme
      Sight.</strong> You can see into Lightly Obscured areas as if they were
      not Obscured, and into Heavily Obscured areas as if they were Lightly
      Obscured.</p><h3>Birds of a Feather</h3><p>Some Liberi have been known to
      give one or more of their feathers to those they hold dear, and to those
      they trust. It is a symbolic gesture, but the feelings and intentions
      behind it are anything but, and shouldn’t be done lightly!</p><p>Upon
      finishing a Long Rest, you may gift one of your feathers to a Creature;
      that Creature becomes part of your Flock. You and that ally gain the
      following benefits:</p><p><strong>Birds of Prey</strong>. When you would
      make an Attack Roll against a Creature that has already been Attacked or
      Damaged by a member of your Flock since your last Turn, you may give
      yourself Advantage on that Attack Roll (no Action required). You may use
      this Feature once per Short Rest.</p><p><strong>Nestmakers.</strong> When
      you roll to determine the amount of Hit Points you restore or Temporary
      Hit Points you grant to a member of your Flock, you can roll those dice
      twice and take either total (no Action required). You may use this Feature
      once per Short Rest.</p><p><strong>Flock Members.</strong> The maximum
      number of members that can be in your Flock (not including you) is equal
      to half your Proficiency Bonus, rounding up. A Creature cannot be in more
      than one Flock; if it joins a second Flock, it is removed from the first
      one. You can remove a Creature from your Flock at any
      time.</p><h3>Preening Feathers</h3><p>Liberi hold the distinction of being
      (debatably) Terra’s most populous race. One might wonder why, until you
      see them in action; most Liberi are possessed of an easy charm and a fair
      countenance, exacerbated by their ability to tailor their wings and
      feathers to better suit their intended impression.</p><p>As a Short Rest
      Activity, you can choose to “preen” yourself. This is not literal, but
      represents you curating your appearance using your feathers and natural
      talent to project a particular impression. Choose either Persuasion or
      Intimidation. Until you next complete a Short or Long Rest, when you make
      a Check using the chosen Skill, you do so at Advantage.</p><p>Once you
      have used this Feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a Long
      Rest.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the
      world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its
      surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient
      Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the
      following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
