      <p>Unlike many Terran Species, who draw their animalistic traits from
      mundane creatures, the Vouivre draw theirs from wyverns, drakes, hydra,
      and various other “lesser dragons.” As befitting those descended from
      dragons, they have large imposing horns, a stature to match, and large
      reptilian tails. It is their might and endurance that defines the Vouivre,
      as they can often be found where their might can best be leveraged;
      military work, construction, demolition, to name but a few. A lesser known
      fact about Vouivre is their ability to regulate their own internal
      metabolism, owing to their evolution within the desolate deserts of Terra.
      As a result, they can go for an exceptional amount of time without food or
      water, further adding to their merit as soldiers.</p><p>Vouivre are not as
      common as many Terran Species, being found mostly in Sargon, with a lesser
      population in Victoria descended from Sargonian expatriates. They can be
      found in other places around the world, as most Terrans can, but only in
      sparse numbers. Within the Sargonian desert, there can be found the
      eponymous Vouivre Alliance, an semi-autonomous region within Sargon where
      even now, a significant population of Terra’s Vouivre
      originate.</p><h1>Vouivre Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong>
      You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Vouivre typically stand
      between 5ft and a half feet, and 6 and a half feet in height, and average
      at 180 pounds in weight. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Life
      Expectancy:</strong> Vouivre reach adulthood at about 18 years old. Their
      enhanced constitution gives them a longer life expectancy of around 120
      years.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Constitution
      Score increases by 2, and two other scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><h1>Vouivre Features</h1><p>As a Vouivre, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Dragonscale</h3><p>While the Vouivre tribes were subdued
      during the Aslanian conquest, the struggle was so intense that the
      Aslanians had no choice but to recognise their might. This might has not
      faded.</p><p>You have 3 DR against Physical Damage.</p><h3>Tough as
      Nails</h3><p>The endurance of the Vouivre is legendary, able to weather
      storms and blows that would fell other races.</p><p>When you would take
      Damage, you can use your Reaction to gain Resistance to those Damage Types
      until the beginning of your next Turn.</p><p>Once you have used this
      Feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><h3>Wyvern’s Might</h3><p>Vouivre originate from harsh desert
      land with harsher wildlife, and have adapted to survive in that
      environment. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Earthmover.</strong> You count as one size larger
      when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag,
      or lift.</p><p><strong>Survivalist.</strong> You can go twice as long as
      normal without food or water.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The
      Ancient Species seized the world of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since
      spread all over its surface, to all its climes and domains. As such, those
      of an Ancient Species possess a versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose
      one from the following benefits when you select this
      Species:</p><p><strong>Durable</strong>. Your Hit Point maximum increases
      by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you gain a Level thereafter,
      your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one Skill
      of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half of your
      Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
