  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Aegir originate from the oceans beyond the land borders of Terra, and
      have the traits of a wide variety of different sea creatures, including
      fish, cetaceans, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Outside of the water, they
      suffer from very dry skin, facing severe symptoms up to and including
      seizures if they do not maintain their skin’s moisture semi-regularly.
      Despite ostensibly hailing from the ocean and being excellent swimmers,
      most Aegir cannot breathe underwater; the Aegir cities are gigantic
      biodomes within the ocean.</p><p>While most Aegir live in the nation of
      Aegir, some coastal regions such as Iberia and Higashi have notable Aegir
      populations who dwell on land. Some of these are multi-generational, and
      the current generation have never seen the cities of the Aegir, but others
      are recent immigrants, leaving their homes for personal
      reasons.</p><h2>Aegirian Traits</h2><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You
      are a Humanoid (Aegir).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Aegir stand between 5
      and 6 feet, and average 150 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The technology of Aegir
      combined with the natural characteristics of the race has extended their
      lifespan dramatically. Aegir reach adulthood around the age of 18, but
      have an average lifespan of 150 years.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 30 feet. You have a Swimming Speed that is equal to
      twice your Walking Speed.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Charisma Score increases by 2, and two other
      Scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h2>Aegirian Features</h2><p>As an
      Aegir, you gain the following features:</p><h3>Oceanborne</h3><p>Aegir did
      not originally evolve under the water. They are semi-aquatic, and
      originally lived on the land near sources of water, before migrating en
      masse into the ocean for reasons unproven. They have since evolved further
      in those conditions, gaining an affinity for the water that is unmatched
      by other species.</p><p><strong>Blessing of the Sea.</strong> You cannot
      contract Oripathy through mundane
      means.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have 30 feet of
      Darkvision.</p><p><strong>Duck and Dive.</strong> While you are swimming,
      you have Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.</p><p><strong>Oxygenated
      Blood.</strong> You can hold your breath for five times as long as
      normal.</p><h3>Ever the Student, Ever the Master</h3><p>As a Long Rest
      Activity, you can choose a willing Creature and either become their
      Student or their Teacher as a Long Rest Activity, gaining the
      corresponding benefit below:. You can only have one Student or Teacher at
      a time; choosing a new one immediately replaces the old
      choice.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>. When you become a Creature’s
      Student, they choose one Skill that they are Proficient in; while you
      remain their Student, you are considered to be Proficient in that Skill.
      If you already have Proficiency in the Skill, you are considered to have
      Expertise instead.</p><p><strong>Teacher.</strong> When you become a
      Creature’s Teacher, you choose one Skill that you are Proficient in; while
      they remain your Student, they are considered to be Proficient in that
      Skill. If you have Expertise in that Skill, they are considered to have
      Expertise instead.</p><h3>Logic Engine</h3><p>As a Short Rest Activity,
      you can analyse any weapon, armour, or toolkit you are not Proficient
      with; you must remain in contact with the item for the entire duration,
      testing and studying it. At the end of that Short Rest, you are considered
      to be Proficient with that item. The maximum number of items you can have
      Proficiency in as a result of this Feature is 1; if you gain Proficiency
      in an item through this Feature while you are at your maximum number, you
      lose Proficiency in the oldest item you are currently Proficient with as a
      result of this Feature.</p><p>Starting at 7th level, the maximum number of
      items you can have Proficiency in through this Feature is increased to
      2.</p><h3>Ancient Versatility</h3><p>The Ancient Species seized the world
      of Terra from the Teekaz, and have since spread all over its surface, to
      all its climes and domains. As such, those of an Ancient Species possess a
      versatility not seen in the Teekaz. Choose one from the following benefits
      when you select this Species:</p><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Your Hit
      Point maximum increases by an amount equal to your Level. Whenever you
      gain a Level thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional
      Hit Point.</p><p><strong>Reliable.</strong> You gain Proficiency in one
      Skill of your choice.</p><p><strong>Tenacious.</strong> You can add half
      of your Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any Saving Throw you are not
      Proficient in.</p>
