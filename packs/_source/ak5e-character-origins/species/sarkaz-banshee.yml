      <p>Even amongst the Sarkaz, the Banshee are unusual. To begin, a majority
      of Banshee are female; male Banshee are principally rare, with their
      current Great Banshee being one such specimen. Despite the fact that their
      current de jure leader is male, Banshee society is matriarchal, due in no
      small part to the fact there simply aren’t many men. Unlike their sister
      Species in the Sarkaz, Banshee do not have tails, but do have horns which
      grow into branch-like shapes, complete with offshoots. They also possess
      wing-like feathered structures on their head, which can sometimes lead to
      them being mistaken for Liberi, and are widely considered to be highly
      physically attractive. There is, however, no mistaking the power of a
      Banshee. Their supreme oral Arts are renowned and feared, and many Banshee
      can cast or manifest Arts by simply speaking or singing.</p><p>In Sarkaz
      society, Banshees are considered to be guardians, or shepherds, of the
      dead, guiding the consciousness of the Sarkaz back to their afterlife
      within the Nephesh. To hear the Banshee’s elegy is to know your life is at
      an end, and they will take you on winds of song to your afterlife. For
      particularly prominent figures or moments, Banshee have a bone whistle
      that is blown to signify the passing of such a moment, and the lamentation
      it represents. Due to their associations with death, the sound of that
      bonewhistle is feared across Terra.</p><h1>Sarkaz Banshee
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> As the direct descendants of
      the Teekaz, you are a Fiend (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> As
      the Sarkaz are, in reality, a collection of related subspecies joined
      under one heading, their physical size and build can vary greatly.
      Generally speaking, however, they fall between 5 feet and 6 and a half
      feet in height, and around 160 pounds in weight. Male Sarkaz tend to be
      taller and heavier, but it is not a given. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The Sarkaz mature at the
      same rate as many other races, reaching adulthood around 18, but have a
      vastly extended lifespan, able to live for many centuries. Most, however,
      do not live this long; the life of the Sarkaz is hard, fraught with peril,
      and Oripathy can shorten their lifespan dramatically, as it does all
      others.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base Walking Speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom and
      Charisma Scores increase by 1, and one other score of your choice increase
      by 1.</p><h1>Sarkaz Banshee Features</h1><p>As a Sarkaz Banshee, you gain
      the following Features:</p><h3>Nephesh</h3><p>All Sarkaz have an
      intrinsic, genetic connection to the Sarkaz of the past and present. The
      memories of the Sarkaz are embedded in their very genetics, allowing
      modern Sarkaz to recall the events of centuries ago as if they were there,
      under the right conditions. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Ancestral Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you would
      make a Lore Check regarding the history of the Sarkaz, or events that
      directly pertain to it, you are treated as having Expertise in that skill.
      If you already have Expertise, you make that Check at
      Advantage.</p><p><strong>Lifelink.</strong> When a Sarkaz you know dies,
      you immediately become aware of it, though you learn nothing about the
      circumstances.</p><h3>Witchcraft</h3><p>Sarkaz have a tighter bond with
      Originum and the curse of Oripathy than other races, and can wield it to
      destructive effect; both for themselves and their foes.</p><p>You have
      access to the Witchcraft Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz Arts. These Arts are
      always prepared. If you cannot cast Arts in another way, Wisdom is your
      Spellcasting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a weapon with the
      Casting Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><p>Once per Long Rest, you
      can cast a Sarkaz Art without expending any Arts Points. The maximum level
      of Sarkaz Art you can cast in this way is controlled by your Character
      Level. At 7th Level, you can cast Sarkaz Arts in this way twice per Long
      Rest.</p><table><thead><tr><td><p

      of the Dead</h3><p>While your song can carry away the souls of the Sarkaz
      to the afterlife, it can also serve as an anchor point, fixing the life of
      a being to the earth. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Death
      Ward.</strong> You can cast the Death Ward Art using a Bone Whistle or
      your singing as the Casting Unit, but only as a Ritual.</p><p><strong>Tool
      Proficiency.</strong> You are Proficient in Instrument (Bone Whistle) and
      Instrument (Microphone), and gain both as starting Equipment. The Bone
      Whistle costs the same as any other Instrument to replace, but can only be
      acquired from Banshee craftswomen.</p><h3>Voice of Ruin</h3><p>The Banshee
      of the Sarkaz are lethal and beautiful in equal measure. Their voice can
      sooth hearts or stop them, their song calm seas or crack walls.</p><p>You
      have access to the Banshee Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz Arts. If you do not
      have the Ability to cast Arts in another way, Charisma is your Arts
      Casting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a weapon with the Casting
      Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The
      Teekaz lost this world to the Ancients long ago, and yet they remain;
      stubbornly clinging to their lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When
      you make a Death Saving Throw, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the
      result of the roll.</p>
