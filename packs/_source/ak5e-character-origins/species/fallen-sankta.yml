      <p>Fallen Sankta are those Sankta who have been rejected by the Law, for
      percieved crimes against the Sankta or Laterano. They have lost their
      sense of "Empathy", and gained "Scorn" in its place.</p><h1>Sankta
      Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> As one of those uplifted by
      The Law, you are a Celestial (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong>
      Sankta typically fall in the upper ranges of five to 6 feet in terms of
      height, and have an average weight of around 150 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> As members of the Teekaz,
      the lifespan of the Sankta is extended beyond what many races on Terra can
      hope for. However, possibly due to the effects The Law has had on them,
      they do not have the ludicrous lifespans of the Sarkaz cousins. They reach
      maturity around 18 years old, and can live for over a hundred years,
      though not not as far as 200.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base
      Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Dexterity Score increases by 2, and two other
      scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Fallen Sankta
      Features</h1><p>As a Fallen Sankta, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Scorn</h3><p>Regardless of the reason for their fall,
      Fallen Sankta have plenty of experience from their previous life of
      controlling their thoughts and feelings. They can channel their hate,
      their anger, and their fear; woe betide anyone who brushes their mind
      against it. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Mental
      Fortress.</strong> You have Advantage on Saving Throws against effects
      that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts, or control your
      mind.</p><p><strong>Mental Inversion.</strong> Whenever you succeed on an
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma Saving Throw, you can use your Reaction
      to inflict Psychic Damage equal to your Character Level to the Creature
      that was the source of that Saving Throw.</p><h3>Lawbringers</h3><p>The
      Sankta tend to prefer ranged combat, not out of cowardice, but because
      that is where they can best apply their frightening accuracy.</p><p>When
      you make an Attack Roll using a Weapon you are Proficient with or as part
      of an Art, you may choose to double your Proficiency Bonus for that Attack
      Roll.</p><p>You can use this Feature a number of times equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long
      Rest, and may only do so once per Attack.</p><h3>Legacy of the
      Law</h3><p>Firearms are a major feature of Lateran faith, and the Sankta
      are the best at using them, skilled as they are in fine and precise
      application of Arts.</p><p>You are Proficient in all Weapons that have the
      Firearm Property. You gain a Patron Firearm version of one of those
      Weapons as Starting Equipment (your choice). When wielded by a Fallen
      Sankta, or a non-Sankta, Attacks made with that Patron Firearm are made at
      Disadvantage.</p><p>You are a Fallen Sankta; you maintain your Proficiency
      with Firearms, but you have Disadvantage when using your Patron
      Firearm.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The Teekaz lost this world to
      the Ancients long ago, and yet they remain; stubbornly clinging to their
      lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When you make a Death Saving Throw,
      you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the result of the roll.</p>
