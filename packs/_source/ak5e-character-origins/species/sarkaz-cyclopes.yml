      <p>Towering over their sister Tribes amongst the Sarkaz, the Cyclopes have
      not one eye but three, a third “sightless” eye situated in the centre of
      their forehead. It is this eye which grants them the power they are most
      known for; the gift, or curse, or prophecy. By tapping into the Nephesh,
      the Cyclopes can divine the future, using the collective consciousness of
      countless dead Sarkaz to calculate the correct conclusion. However,
      Cyclopean prophesies are often tinged with tragedy, and unfortunately more
      often than not are true, at least in that respect. The Nephesh is a place
      driven by grief and rage, and anything drawn from it is similarly tainted.
      To be a Cyclopes is to struggle against a sorrowful destiny, knowing that
      it will come to pass.</p><p>The Cyclopes are extremely rarely seen; the
      majority remaining have exiled themselves to the Sami Ice-fields to combat
      the threat of the Collapsals they foresaw, fighting alongside the
      Samifjod. Even aside from those, their foresight and tendency for tragedy
      to befall them and those around them means that a majority live a hermit’s
      lifestyle, in the caves and mountains of Terra. Occasionally, however, a
      prophecy will move one so greatly as to bring them out of
      isolation.</p><h1>Sarkaz Cyclopes Traits</h1><p><strong>Creature
      Type:</strong> As the direct descendants of the Teekaz, you are a Fiend
      (Humanoid).</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> As the Sarkaz are, in reality, a
      collection of related subspecies joined under one heading, their physical
      size and build can vary greatly. Generally speaking, however, they fall
      between 5 feet and 6 and a half feet in height, and around 160 pounds in
      weight. Male Sarkaz tend to be taller and heavier, but it is not a given.
      Your size is Medium.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Variant: Giant
      Stature</strong></p><p>You are notably taller than most other Sarkaz,
      falling above 6 and a half feet in height, while many can be over seven
      feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p>When you choose this species, you
      can choose for your size to be Large. If you do, your Strength Score
      increases by 1, but you cannot wear equipment that isn’t made for someone
      of your size.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> The
      Sarkaz mature at the same rate as many other races, reaching adulthood
      around 18, but have a vastly extended lifespan, able to live for many
      centuries. Most, however, do not live this long; the life of the Sarkaz is
      hard, fraught with peril, and Oripathy can shorten their lifespan
      dramatically, as it does all others.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your
      base Walking Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Improvement:</strong> Your Wisdom Score increases by 2, and one other
      score of your choice increase by 1.</p><h1>Sarkaz Cyclopes
      Features</h1><p>As a Sarkaz Cyclopes, you gain the following
      Features:</p><h3>Nephesh</h3><p>All Sarkaz have an intrinsic, genetic
      connection to the Sarkaz of the past and present. The memories of the
      Sarkaz are embedded in their very genetics, allowing modern Sarkaz to
      recall the events of centuries ago as if they were there, under the right
      conditions. You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Ancestral
      Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you would make a Lore Check regarding the
      history of the Sarkaz, or events that directly pertain to it, you are
      treated as having Expertise in that skill. If you already have Expertise,
      you make that Check at Advantage.</p><p><strong>Lifelink.</strong> When a
      Sarkaz you know dies, you immediately become aware of it, though you learn
      nothing about the circumstances.</p><h3>Witchcraft</h3><p>Sarkaz have a
      tighter bond with Originum and the curse of Oripathy than other races, and
      can wield it to destructive effect; both for themselves and their
      foes.</p><p>You have access to the Witchcraft Arts Pool; these are Sarkaz
      Arts. These Arts are always prepared. If you cannot cast Arts in another
      way, Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for these Arts; you do not need a
      weapon with the Casting Unit Property to cast these Arts.</p><p>Once per
      Long Rest, you can cast a Sarkaz Art without expending any Arts Points.
      The maximum level of Sarkaz Art you can cast in this way is controlled by
      your Character Level. At 7th Level, you can cast Sarkaz Arts in this way
      twice per Long Rest.</p><table><thead><tr><td><p

      Luck</strong></p><p>The source of their power, the dead and damned,
      ensures that no matter how noble their intentions, their prophecies will
      often reflect poorly onto themselves, and those around them. For this
      reason, many Cyclopes choose to live in isolation.</p><p>Your other
      Species Features generate points of Bad Luck when used (consult those
      Features to see how much they generate). When a point of Bad Luck is
      generated, roll a d20 and record the result. Whenever you roll a d20 (not
      including Death Saves), if the natural result on the dice is equal to a
      number you have rolled for a point of Bad Luck, then that roll
      automatically fails, regardless of the final score. That Bad Luck Point is
      then removed.</p><p>If you roll the same number for multiple Bad Luck
      points, only the first point applies. All points of Bad Luck are removed
      whenever you finish a Long Rest.</p></blockquote><h3>Divine the
      Spirits</h3><p>By inquiring into the Nephesh, the spirits of long dead
      Sarkaz, a Cyclopes can seemingly divine the future. As the origin of these
      predictions is itself tragic, however, such tends to invite bad luck upon
      the Cyclopes.</p><p>By conducting a 10 minute ritual, you can commune with
      the collective spirits of all the countless dead Sarkaz. For the next
      minute, you can ask the spirits up to three questions. The spirits can
      only give three possible answers to your question; “yes”, “no”, or they
      can refuse to answer. They are capable of speculating about future events,
      and are relatively up to date on current events as each dead Sarkaz adds
      to their knowledge (For the sake of convenience, its safe to say that if
      an event happened more than a week ago, they could know of it). However,
      they will not know things which they could not have known in life, such as
      well-kept secrets that do not concern the Sarkaz, or things no-one was
      there to witness. Ultimately, what the spirits know is down to DM
      discretion. They are not capable of directly lying to you, but their
      information is always tainted with sorrow and rage, and they may attempt
      to mislead you to satisfy vengeance or spite. After the time is up or you
      have asked three questions, the ritual ends.</p><p>You can only use this
      Feature once per Short Rest. Additionally, if you use this Feature, you
      generate a point of Bad Luck.</p><h3>Precognitive</h3><p>The third eye of
      the Cyclopes allows them to see not just into the distant future, but also
      the immediate; a warning shout, a nudge, a grabbed collar to prevent a
      fall; they act on reflex, based on the flashes their eye shows
      them.</p><p>When a Creature you can see within 30ft of you makes a d20
      Roll, as a Reaction you can either;</p><ul><li><p>Roll 1d6, and subtract
      the amount rolled from the result of that Roll.</p></li><li><p>Roll 1d6,
      and add the amount rolled to the result of that Roll.</p></li></ul><p>If
      you do, you generate a point of Bad Luck. A Creature can only be affected
      by this Feature once per Turn.</p><h3>Cling to the World</h3><p>The Teekaz
      lost this world to the Ancients long ago, and yet they remain; stubbornly
      clinging to their lives, and their place on Terra.</p><p>When you make a
      Death Saving Throw, you may add your Proficiency Bonus to the result of
      the roll.</p>
