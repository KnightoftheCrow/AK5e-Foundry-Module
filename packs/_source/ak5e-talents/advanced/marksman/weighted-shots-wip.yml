      Creature’s Movement Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of their
      Turn. It is considered to be the first time you hit a Creature if you have
      rolled Initiative since the last time you hit them with an
      Attack.</p><p><strong>Module:</strong> Their Speed is reduced by 30 feet
      instead.</p>
