      additional Damage to the target equal to half of the Ability Score used
      for that Attack. The Damage Type is the same as one present on that Attack
      (your Choice, if there are multiple).</p><p><strong>Module:</strong> The
      additional Damage becomes equal to the Ability Score used for that
