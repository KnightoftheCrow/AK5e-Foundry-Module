    value: >-
      <p>When a Creature makes an Attack against you, and doesn’t have Advantage
      on the Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction to give that Attack Roll
      Disadvantage. You can use this Feature a number of times equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Module:</strong> You can now use this Feature even
      when the Attack has Advantage.</p>
