    value: >-
      <p>You learn two Instructions of your Choice from the Instructor Branch of
      the Guard Class. Furthermore, you gain 2 Instruction Dice, which are d6s.
      While you have Instruction Dice remaining, you may take the Help Action to
      aid an ally in attacking a Creature as a Bonus Action, and the target of
      that Attack can be within 30ft of you, rather than within 5ft. However, if
      you do so, you must use an Instruction as part of that Help Action. You
      regain all expended Instruction Dice upon completing a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Module:</strong> You gain a third Instruction Dice,
      and your Instruction Dice become d8s.</p><p><strong>Not
      Automated.</strong></p>
