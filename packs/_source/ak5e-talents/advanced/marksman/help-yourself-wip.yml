      Attack, you steal 1 of their Damage Reduction, reducing their Damage
      Reduction by 1 and increasing yours by 1. At the end of your Turn, if you
      have not hit a Creature with an Attack, you lose any Damage Reduction you
      gained from this Feature, and it is returned to the Creatures you stole it
      from.</p><p><strong>Module:</strong> The amount of Damage Reduction you
      steal when you hit a Creature with an Attack is increased to
